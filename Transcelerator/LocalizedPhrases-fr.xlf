                <source>Luke made it clear that the church took care of the widows who had no one to provide for them. The apostles were doing this work of caring for the widows. This was taking time which they needed to teach and preach the Word of God, and for prayer. So the members of the church chose a group of seven men to do the other tasks.</source>
                <target state="translated">Luc a dit clairement que l'église s'occupait des veuves qui n'avaient personne pour subvenir à leurs besoins. Les apôtres faisaient ce travail de soins aux veuves. Cela prenait du temps dont ils avaient besoin pour enseigner et prêcher la Parole de Dieu, et pour prier. Les membres de l'église ont donc choisi un groupe de sept hommes pour faire les autres tâches.</target>
