                <source>Key Term Check: He is the supreme being to be worshiped. In English, the term "God" with a capital "G" is used to refer to the one supreme Creator. The term "god" with a small "g", as in "a god" or "many gods", can refer to any spiritual being that people worship. The Greek word theos can be used in the same two ways.</source>

                <source>In many languages the term for God is a proper name and cannot be used to refer to anyone except the one supreme creator of the world. It cannot be pluralized. (Or, if it can be pluralized, the meaning may be something very different from the English "gods". In one language, the plural form of God, meant "God and those who follow him" and was an appropriate way to translate "saints".) (See "God" in KBT.)</source>

                <source>Key Term Check: Forgiveness always involves two people, one of whom has done something wrong to the other and offended him. Forgiveness takes place when the one, who was offended, sets aside his right to justice and decides not to punish the offender, as he deserved. If the one who offended repents and accepts this forgiveness, the result is that the relationship between the two, which was broken by the offense, is restored and the guilt of the offender is removed.</source>

                <source>Key Term Check: In English, the term "God," with a capital "G," is used to refer to the one supreme Creator. The term "god," with a lower case "g", as in "a god" or "many gods", can refer to any spiritual being that people worship. The Greek word "theos," can be used in the same two ways. In many languages the term for God is a proper name and cannot be used to refer to anyone except the one supreme creator of the world. It cannot be pluralized.</source>

                <source>Key Term Check: In ordinary English the word "inherit" means "to receive something belonging to your father after he dies". But in the use of the term in this passage, where something is inherited from God, there is no thought of anyone dying. The meaning is "to receive something that God has promised to give you, provided that you fulfill certain conditions". To inherit the kingdom of God a Christian/believer enjoys having God rule over him.</source>

                <source>They, too, had no food in Canaan because of the famine, so all of Joseph's brothers, except (for) Benjamin, went to Egypt to buy food. When they arrived, they had to go to Joseph to buy/get grain. They did not recognize him, but he recognized them. He accused the brothers of being foreign spies. They insisted that they were not spies, but rather were brothers who were in need of food. They mentioned that their father and youngest brother were still back in Canaan. Joseph told them that he would not believe them unless they brought their youngest brother to him. So he kept Simeon in jail, and sent the other nine brothers home to get/bring back Benjamin. When they arrived home, they found that the money that was to have been payment for the grain was in their grain sacks. They told Jacob about all that had happened. Jacob was very upset that now he had lost Simeon too (in addition to Joseph). So he said that he would not allow his nine sons/the brothers to take Benjamin back with them to Egypt, because he feared that Benjamin, too, would not return.</source>

The term "god" with a small "g", as in "a god" or "many gods", can refer to any spiritual being that people worship. The Greek word theos can be used in the same two ways. In many languages the term for God is a proper name and cannot be used to refer to anyone except the one supreme creator of the world. It cannot be pluralized.</source>

                <source>Key Term Check: Forgiveness always involves two people, one of whom has done something wrong to the other and offended him. Forgiveness takes place when the one, who was offended, sets aside his right to justice and decides not to punish the offender, as he deserved. If the one who offended repents and accepts this forgiveness, the result is that the relationship between the two, which was broken by the offense, is restored and the guilt of the offender is removed.</source>

The Jews did the ceremony as a religious rite which dedicated the child to God and physically marked him as a Jew.

The word used here means a gracious, outgoing, active interest in the welfare of another person. John used the same word to explain how much God loves us [John 3:16; 1 John 4:9-11. Jesus used the word to talk about loving God and loving one's neighbor as one loves himself [Mark 12:30-31]. Paul used the word to tell how a husband should act toward his wife [Eph. 5:25]. We should love our enemies the same as God loves us and the same as we love anyone else, including our wives and God. The translator must have good reasons if he/she has used a different word for love in this verse than he/she would use in those other contexts. See "love" in KBT.</source>

The word also referred to the center of a person's feelings, desires, and emotions. This verse refers to the heart as the center of emotions. The translation should use the term for whatever body part the culture says is that center of emotions, not necessarily the word for the heart. See "heart" in KBT.</source>

                <source>Key Term Check: Forgiveness always involves two people, one of whom has done something wrong to the other and offended him. Forgiveness takes place when the one, who was offended, sets aside his right to justice and decides not to punish the offender, as he deserved. If the one who offended repents and accepts this forgiveness, the result is that the relationship between the two, which was broken by the offense, is restored and the guilt of the offender is removed.</source>

                <source>Key Term Check: The word "abyss" (Greek abussos) literally means a place that is so deep that it has no bottom to it. In Jewish tradition it referred first to the water under the earth, "the deep". It also referred to the place where certain evil spirits were put in prison and tormented after being expelled from heaven. They will be kept there till the Judgment. The abyss (bottomless pit) has this meaning in Rev. 9:1, 2, 11; 11:7; 17:8; 20:1, 3. (See "abyss" in KBT in the "Hell" entry.)</source>

The tabernacle was the portable sanctuary that the people of Israel built under God's direction in the early years of their history, while they were traveling in the wilderness. God was present in the tabernacle in a very special way. In some passages the reference is not to the man-made tabernacle which existed in this world, but to the corresponding tabernacle in heaven, the spiritual reality which the earthly tabernacle represents.

                <source>Key Term Check: Forgiveness always involves two people, one of whom has done something wrong to the other and offended him. Forgiveness takes place when the one who was offended sets aside his right to justice and decides not to punish the offender as he deserved. If the one who offended repents and accepts this forgiveness, then the result is that the relationship between the two, which was broken by the offense, is restored, and the guilt of the offender is removed.</source>
