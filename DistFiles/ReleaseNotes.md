### How to participate
1. Set up a headset microphone and (probably) an external A/D USB converter.  
        Reportedly some laptops can do an OK recording job right out of the microphone 
        jack, so if you can't locate an external convert, please do some experimenting 
        anyways.</p>
2. Install Paratext, and get a project with some translated scripture on it.  
        If you want to just use English, that's fine too. Currently SayMore hides most 
        resource texts, but you are allowed to choose "GNTUK" if you have that resource 
        installed.</p>
3. Either try it yourself, or if possible, get a non-technical native speaker to 
record for a while in his/her own language. Teach them to find a text, record 
each script item, check their recording, and re-record as necessary. After they 
get the basics, please teach them to use the keyboard, not the mouse (which is 
inefficient for such a repetitive task). Please take note of their reading 
fluency; a large proportion of the intended audience will struggle to read 
naturally, and that's why the interface is designed to make it easy to listen 
and re-record, as many times as necessary.  So it would help to hear 
results from people with a range of reading abilities.
