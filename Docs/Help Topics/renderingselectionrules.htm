<h2>Advanced: Biblical Terms Rendering Selection Rules</h2>

<p>For biblical terms that are used in a lot of questions and have more than one rendering, it can sometimes be advantageous to define a rule that can override the <a href="biblicalterms.htm#default-rendering">default rendering</a> for some questions. This is most likely to be helpful when the renderings represent different surface forms and the correct form can be fairly consistently inferred from nearby words. You might find other useful cases, such as when a term has two different senses and nearby words can be used to guess at which sense is meant in a question. Defining rendering selection rules requires a fairly sophisticated understanding of the target vernacular as well as the ability to think abstractly. In some cases it might also require the ability to write a well-formed <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a>. If your team does not have anyone with these skills, do not worry. Transcelerator can still be used successfully without defining any rendering selection rules. However, if you find that translators are frequently having to select different default renderings, you can try to see if a rule can simplify their job.</p>
