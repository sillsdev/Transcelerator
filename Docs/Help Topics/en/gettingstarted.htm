<h2>Getting Started with Transcelerator</h2>

<h3>How to Run Transcelerator</h3>

<p>
After installing Transcelerator, restart <a
href="https://paratext.org/">Paratext</a>. If you have properly associated your Paratext project with the appropriate keyboard for entering vernacular text, this same keyboard will be activated when translating questions in Transcelerator.</p>
<p>
To run Transcelerator, first open the desired project (not a resource) in Paratext. On the <span class="ui">Tools</span> menu for that project, select <span class="ui">Transcelerator</span>. <span class="note">Note: In Paratext 9 and later, the menu icon <i class="material-icons">menu</i> is in the upper left corner of the title bar for the project window.</span></p>
<h4 class="hint">Hint:</h4>
<p class="hint">Transcelerator gets information about the terms in the Major Biblical Terms list from Paratext. If you are using a custom set of terms for your project that does not have many of those terms or you have not done much work in identifying the renderings for the terms, Paratext will use statistical glossing to guess at the renderings. While this actually does a very good job for many terms in most languages, there will be mistakes and omissions. For best results, take the time to think about and assign appropriate renderings for the terms in the passages to be checked. This will save time when translating the questions in Transcelerator and result in more consistent translations of the checking questions that use those terms. Not only will this make it easier for respondents to properly relate the questions to the biblical passage, it will also reinforce and establish those terms (or show where the rendering of terms is confusing).</p>

<h3>Filtering by Scripture Range</h3>
<p>Typically when preparing questions for comprehension checking, you will be focused on a single book or a range of chapters or sections within a book. To filter the display of questions so that you are seeing only the ones that are relevant to the passage you are preparing to check, on the <span class="ui">Filter</span> menu, select <span class="ui">Set Reference Range</span>. See more details about<a href="filtering.htm"><i class="material-icons">filter_alt</i>filtering</a>.</p>

<h3>Translating a Question</h3>
<p>
To translate a question, simply click the <span class="ui">Translation</span> cell in the row of the question to be translated. Initially, the contents of that cell—if any—will be selected. So if you begin typing right away, whatever you type will completely replace the existing text. If you just need to replace <em>part</em> of the existing text or add words or punctuation, first adjust the selection using standard Windows editing procedures (e.g., single click to change to an insertion point, double-click to select a word, etc.). If a question has one or more <a href="biblicalterms.htm">biblical terms</a>, you can select the correct rendering for the term in the list of terms in the lower pane and it will be inserted into the translation (replacing the existing one if it is selected). Once the translation is complete, you can press <span class="keyname">Tab</span> or <span class="keyname">Enter</span> or simply click in a another cell. Unless you press <span class="keyname">Esc</span> to cancel the edit, Transcelerator will automatically assume that you intended to confirm your translation as complete. <span class="note">Note: There is no way to store a provisional or incomplete manual translation. If you clear the checkbox in the <span class="ui">Confirmed</span> column, the translation will revert to Transcelerator’s guessed translation.</span>
