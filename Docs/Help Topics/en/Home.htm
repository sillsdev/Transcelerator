<h2>Welcome to Transcelerator Help</h2>

<p>To learn about one of the topics covered by this help
system, click one of the links below.</p>

<p>Additional information is available on-line and can be
accessed from the <a href="https://software.sil.org/transcelerator/">Transcelerator
home page</a>. You can also use <a

community support site</a> to seek help with a problem or to request a feature.</p>

<h3>What is Transcelerator?</h3>
<p>Transcelerator is a <a
href="https://paratext.org/">Paratext</a> plugin that helps with comprehension
checking in three ways: First, Transcelerator uses information from the
Paratext Biblical Terms tool to help translate biblical terms and proper names.
Second, as you translate questions, Transcelerator gradually “learns” common
phrases — you just have to confirm the translation and move on. Finally, it helps
you get ready to conduct a comprehension checking session by producing a script
that can be printed or shared electronically, or by saving the questions in a
form that can be used by <a href="https://scriptureforge.org/">Scripture
Forge</a>.</p>

<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>
Transcelerator presents a translator with a list of comprehension questions. The user fills in translations of those questions, optionally selecting from existing known renderings of key <a href="biblicalterms.htm"><i class="material-icons">history_edu</i>biblical terms</a>. As work progresses, Transcelerator uses the biblical terms and growing body of translated questions to guess at the translations of the remaining questions.</p>
<p>
By default, Transcelerator initially displays the questions so that identical questions and questions having very similar frames (e.g., “What did x say to y?”) sort near the top of the list. Once the user fills in a few of these repeated and similar questions, Transcelerator fills in “instant” translations for the other questions with a very high degree of reliability. In some cases, they will already be marked as confirmed, and in other cases, the user will need to go through and confirm them.</p>
<p>
For more complex questions, Transcelerator’s guesses will usually be incorrect, though they might contain words or phrases that are correct and helpful. The more consistent you are in translating similar phrases, the more likely Transcelerator will “learn” how those phrases should be translated in other questions. Please do not be surprised when Transcelerator fails to provide the same quality of guessed translations as other automated translation tools such as Google Translate. Unlike those tools, Transcelerator has no other corpus of texts on which to train and calibrate. It is seeing your project’s language for the very first time.
