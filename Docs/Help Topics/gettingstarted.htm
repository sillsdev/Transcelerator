<h2>Getting Started with Transcelerator</h2>

<h3>How to Run Transcelerator</h3>

<p>
After installing Transcelerator, restart Paratext. If you have properly associated your Paratext project with the appropriate keyboard for entering vernacular text, this same keyboard will be activated when translating questions in Transcelerator.</p>
<p>
To run Transcelerator, first open the desired project (not a reference project) in Paratext. Open the menu for that project and on the Tools menu click Transcelerator. Note: In Paratext 9 and later, the menu icon is in the upper left corner of the title bar for the project window.</p>
<h4>Hint:</h4>
<p class="hint">Transcelerator gets information about the terms in the Major Biblical Terms list from Paratext. If you are using a custom set of terms for your project or have not done much work in identifying the renderings for these terms, Paratext will use statistical glossing to guess at the renderings. While this actually does an amazingly good job for many terms in most languages, there will be mistakes and omissions. For best results, take the time to think about and assign appropriate renderings for the terms in the passages to be checked. This will save time when translating the questions in Transcelerator and result in translated checking questions that use those terms more consistently. Not only will this make it easier for respondents to properly relate the questions to the biblical passage, it will also reinforce and establish those terms (or show where the rendering of terms is confusing).</p>

<h3>Translating a Question</h3>
<p>
To translate a question, simply click the Translation cell in the row of the question to be translated. Initially, the contents of that cell—if any—will be selected. So if you begin typing right away, whatever you type will completely replace the existing text. If you just need to add words or punctuation or replace <em>part<em> of the existing text, first adjust the selection using standard Windows editing procedures (e.g., single click to change to an insertion point, double-click to select a word, etc.). If a question has one or more <a href="biblicalterms.htm">biblical terms<a>, you can select the correct rendering for the term in the list of terms in the lower pane and it will be inserted into the translation (replacing the existing one if it is selected). Once the translation is complete, you can press <span class="keyname">Tab</span> or <span class="keyname">Enter</span> or simply click in a another cell. Unless you press span class="keyname">Esc</span> to cancel the edit, Transcelerator will automatically assume that you intended to confirm your translation as complete.</p>
