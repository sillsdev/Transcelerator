<h2>Overview of Basic Features</h2>

<h3>File</h3>
<ul class="icon-list">
  <li><i class="material-icons">save</i><span class="ui">Save</span> on demand or <span class="ui">Auto Save</span> saves every time a translation is changed (on by default)</li>
  <li><i class="material-icons">refresh</i><span class="ui">Reload</span> forces a re-analysis of the questions to improve guessed translations (after manual editing or addition of questions)</li>
  <li><span class="ui"><a href="generatescript.htm"><i class="material-icons">grading</i>Generate Checking Script</a></span>produces an HTML-format script by retrieving Scripture portions from Paratext and interleaving them with the relevant questions. The script can be customized in various ways. Once produced, it can be printed or shared electronically.</li>
  <li><img class="inline-img" src="sf_logo_small.png" style="height:24px; margin-top:0px; position: relative; top: 6px;"><span class="ui">Produce Scripture Forge Files</span> saves translated questions in a format that can be used by <a href="https://software.sil.org/transcelerator/working-with-scripture-forge/">Scripture Forge</a>. These files will be automatically synchronized when using Send/Receive in Paratext. <span class="note">Note: Icon displays green when this is toggled <em>on</em>.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>Editing/Navigation</h3>
<p>On the <span class="ui">Edit</span> menu, select <span class="ui">Previous Untranslated Question</span> and <span class="ui">Next Untranslated Question</span> to go to the next question that does not yet have a confirmed translation. When editing a translation use <span class="ui">Shift Word(s) Right</span> and <span class="ui">Shift Word(s) Left</span> to <a href="reorderingwords.htm"><i class="material-icons">compare_arrows</i>reorder the current or selected word</a>. On the toolbar there are also two buttons that allow the user to control whether to send (<img src="SendSync.png">) and receive (<img src="ReceiveSync.png">) Scripture references to keep Transcelerator in sync with other applications (e.g., Paratext) when navigating.</p>
<h4>Question Customization</h4>
<p>Since there are limitations to using a “canned” set of questions to check comprehension, Transcelerator allows the addition of custom questions and the exclusion or modification of existing source questions as needed. The command for customizing the source questions are accessible using the context menu in the main grid:</p>
<ul class="icon-list">
  <li id="exclude-question"><a href="editingquestions.htm#excluding"><i class="material-icons">thumb_down_alt</i><span class="ui">Exclude Question</span></a> that is not useful for the intended audience.</li>
  <li><a href="editingquestions.htm"><i class="material-icons">thumb_up_alt</i><span class="ui">Include Question</span></a> that was previously excluded (see <a href="#view-excluded"><i class="material-icons">all_inclusive</i>viewing excluded questions</a>).</li>
  <li><a href="editingquestions.htm"><i class="material-icons">edit</i><span class="ui">Edit Question</span></a> to select an alternate form or manually alter the wording.</li>
  <li><a href="addingquestions.htm"><i class="material-icons">add</i>Add a <span class="ui">New Question</span></a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="filtering.htm"><i class="material-icons">filter_alt</i>Filtering</a> and Sorting</h3>
<p>Transcelerator allows the list of questions to be filtered in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By reference range</li>
  <li>Textual</li>
  <li>Based on whether or not biblical terms have renderings (i.e., vernacular equivalents)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the questions can be sorted by any of the columns by clicking the column header. Click the header of the sorted column a second time to reverse the sort order.</p>

<h3>View</h3>
<p>To eliminate unnecessary elements of the user interface (especially helpful when working on a small display) the following items can be hidden:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="ui">Generated Translation Details</span> - Provides technical analysis details mainly useful for understanding how guessed translations are being determined.</li>
  <li><span class="ui">Edit Question Column</span> - This column is useful when customizing source questions. (Hidden by default.) See <a href="editingquestions.htm">Editing Questions</a> for more information.</li>
  <li><span class="ui">Answers and Comments</span> - Often helpful when translating questions, but not strictly necessary.</li>
  <li><span class="ui">Toolbar</span> - Shows the box for textual filtering, the synchronized navigation buttons and some status information.</li>
  <li><span class="ui">Biblical Terms Pane</span> - Makes it easy to select the correct rendering for biblical terms used in a question.</li>
</ul>
<p id="view-excluded"><i class="material-icons">all_inclusive</i>If questions have been <a href="editingquestions.htm#view-excluded-questions">excluded</a>, they can be displayed (primarily so they can be re-included if so desired) by selecting <span class="ui">Excluded Questions</span>.</p>
<p id="view-zoom"><i class="material-icons">zoom_in</i>Use Zoom In (Ctrl + Plus) or Zoom Out (Ctrl + Minus) to increase or decrease the size of the non-vernacular text in the main grid. <span class="note">Note: The font and size of the vernacular text displayed in the <span class="ui">Translation</span> column is determined by the font settings for the vernacular language in Paratext.</p>
<p><i class="material-icons">language</i>Transcelerator can display the source questions and the user interface in any locale that was included when it was installed. Select the desired language from the <span class="ui">Display Language</span> menu.</p>
