<h2>Como reordenar palabras en una traducción</h2>
<p>Although Transcelerator is able to suggest likely vernacular renderings for key biblical terms and other words it has learned as you translate questions, it will most often suggest a translation where the word order  corresponds to the order of words in English. For several common patterns, you might be able to add <a href="adjustments.htm">preprocessing question adjustments</a> to reorder parts of questions to more closely match the order of words in the target vernacular. But you will still find that there are frequently situations where you need to move words or phrases around to get them in the correct order. Of course, you can do this using normal cut and paste operations. However, Transcelerator also provides some special keyboard shortcuts to help you do simple reordering more quickly. The <span class="ui">Shift Word(s) Right</span> and <span class="ui">Shift Word(s) Left</span> commands corresponding to these shortcuts are available on the <span class="ui">Edit</span> menu whenever you enter a Translation cell to start editing it. You can, of course, use the commands on the menu, but they are primarily there as a convenience to remind you of the shortcuts.</p>

<p>When a single word needs to be moved to the right or the left to shift it into its proper position in the translation, simply place the insertion point anywhere in the word and press <span class="key-name">Alt+Shift+Right arrow</span> or  <span class="key-name">Alt+Shift+Left arrow</span>. Cuando presione el atajo de teclado por primera vez, la palabra actual será seleccionada — junto con el espacio precedente o el siguiente espacio — y desplazado una palabra a la derecha o a la izquierda. Each subsequent time you use the shortcut, it will be shifted one more word over. Transcelerator tries to be smart about whether or not to include adjacent punctuation, but if it is not selecting the right text automatically, you can select the exact characters you want to move as described below.</p>
<p>If you need to shift multiple words, break off part of a word, or control exactly what spaces or punctuation are going to be moved, simply select the exact text you want to move before you press <span class="key-name">Alt+Shift+Right arrow</span> or  <span class="key-name">Alt+Shift+Left arrow</span>. In this case, you will need to decide whether to include the leading or trailing spaces (or other word-break characters) to get the desired result.</p>

<p><span class="hint">Hint: If you use the commands to reorder words and accidentally mess things up, you can revert your changes and avoid saving them as a confirmed translation by selecting <span class="key-name">Esc</span>. This will discard all edits to the translation, not just the changes made by reordering words.</span></p>
