<h2>Adding Questions</h2>

<p>Since there are limitations to using a “canned” set of questions to check comprehension, Transcelerator allows the addition of custom questions. To add a question, do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select an existing question for the verse(s) you want to ask about. If there is no existing question, find a question close to (immediately before or after) the place where you want to insert a new question. <span class="hint">This will be easier if you sort the questions by reference, which you can do by clicking the <span class="ui">Reference</span> column header</span></li>
  <li>Open the context menu and select <span class="ui">New Question</span>.</li>
  <li>In the <span class="ui">New Question</span> dialog box, change the Scripture Reference if needed. If this question covers more than one verse, select the end verse.</li>
  <li>Change the category if needed. By default, the category will be selected based on the question you had selected in the main window. <span class="note">Most sections of Scripture in the New Testament have <span class="ui">Overview</span> questions that ask about the section in general, followed by <span class="ui">Detail</span> questions that work through the verses and cover more specific information. Much of the Old Testament currently has only detail questions. <a href="generatescript.htm#overview-and-detail">more information...</a></span></li>
  <li>Select the location in the list of existing questions where the new question should be inserted. By default, Transcelerator will put the new question after other questions for that verse, but you can select a different location by clicking a row or by using the green up and down arrow keys. The small right-pointing arrow (<img src="control_right.png" style="margin-top:-3px; position: relative; top: 4px;">) indicates the exact position where the new question is to be inserted.</li>
  <li>Type the question in English or select <span class="ui">I just want to add a question without providing an English version.</span> Although an English version of the question is not required, entering one will enable Transcelerator to analyze the vernacular translation with the potential of improving its guesses about other questions. Also, if you decide the share your additions with others or you later need technical support, the English version will prove useful. <span class="note">Note: If your team normally uses a localization other than English, there is unfortunately no place to type the question in that language. Technically, you can type your question here in any language, but it might prove a little confusing later if you type it in a language other than English.</span></li>
  <li>Type the question in the target language. <span class="note">Note: If you do not type an English version of the question, this is required. Otherwise, the translation can be entered later in the main window. (This can be especially helpful in a situation where a facilitator is adding questions but another team member who is more fluent in the target vernacular will be translating the questions.)</span></li>
  <li>Type the answer, if desired. <span class="note">Note: Transcelerator does not currently do any analysis of answers, nor does it allow for translation of the answers for the built-in questions, though it might some day in the future. It merely includes the answers in the generated scripts. Since it assumes that all answers are in English, it uses the default font used for English text. However, if it seems useful to type the answer in the target vernacular or even in another language of wider communication used by your team and the text displays correctly with this font, feel free to do so.</span></li>
  <li>Proofread everything carefully. Transcelerator does not allow for later corrections in answers, so it is especially important to make sure this is correct.</li>
  <li>Click <span class="ui">OK</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="note">Note: If you have authored a question that you would like to share for possible inclusion in a future version of Transcelerator, please <a href="mailto:transcelerator_feedback@sil.org?subject=Additional questions">contact the development team</a>. We would especially welcome more complete sets of well-written questions for the Old Testament books that have only scant coverage.</span></p>
