\oh Overview
\tqref ACT 1.1-5
\bttq What information did Luke, the writer of this book, give in this introduction?
\tqe Luke reminded his readers that he was about to continue the true story about Jesus and his apostles that Luke had written in his first book. (1)
\tqe He also reminded his readers that Jesus had promised that his Father would send his followers the Holy Spirit. (5)
\bttq What do you think an apostle of Jesus is?
\tqe Key Term Check: To be an apostle of Jesus means to be a messenger/ambassador, who represents Jesus, who proclaims the message about Jesus. (See "apostle" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think it means to make a promise?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that someone will make a declaration that he will do or will refrain from doing something specified. (See "promise" in KBT in the "covenant" entry.)
\dh Details
\bttq To whom did the writer of Acts address this book?
\tqe He addressed this book to a person whom he respected. The person's name was Theophilus. (1-2)
\bttq What do you think is the reason for a person or place to have a name?
\tqe Key Term Check: A name is a label that identifies a person or place. (See "name" in KBT.)
\bttq What had the writer written about in his first book?
\tqe In his first book the writer had told about all the things that Jesus did and taught while he lived on earth. (1-2)
\bttq What did Jesus do in the forty days just before he returned to heaven? 
\tqe The Holy Spirit guided Jesus as Jesus gave the men, whom he had chosen as apostles, teaching/commands/instructions beyond what he had given them before that time. (1-3)
\bttq Where do you think heaven is?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is that part of God's creation above the earth and the waters, including "air" and "space," and serves as home for God and the spirits who serve Him. (See "heaven" in KBT.)
\bttq Who do you think the Holy Spirit is?
\tqe Key Term Check: He is God's spirit through whom he acts, reveals His will, and empowers individuals. (See "Holy Spirit" in KBT in the "spirit" entry.)
\bttq How did the apostles of Jesus know that Jesus was truly alive again?
\tqe He showed himself to them many times in ways that convinced them that he was truly alive again. (3)
\bttq What did Jesus talk to them about during those forty days?
\tqe He continued to teach them about the kingdom of God. (3)
\bttq What do you think the kingdom of God is?
\tqe Key Term Check: The kingdom of God, rather than being a territory over which God rules, is the presence of God ruling in the lives of men. (See "kingdom of God" in KBT.)
\bttq For what reason had Jesus again talked with his apostles about the kingdom of God?
\tqe Jesus was preparing the apostles to tell people about him in all parts of the earth. They would begin spreading the message about him after they received the Holy Spirit. (3)
\an (Note: See 1:6-8.)
\bttq For what reason did Jesus tell the apostles to wait in Jerusalem?
\tqe He told them to continue to wait in Jerusalem for a few days, until [God], his Father, sent them the Holy Spirit. (4-5)
\bttq Who do you think God is?
\tqe Key Term Check: He is the supreme being to be worshipped. In English, the term "God" with a capital "g" is used to refer to the one supreme Creator. The term "god" with a small "g", as in "a god" or "many gods", can refer to any spiritual being that people worship. The Greek word theos can be used in the same two ways.
\an In many languages the term for God is a proper name and cannot be used to refer to anyone except the one supreme creator of the world. It cannot be pluralized. (Or, if it can be pluralized, the meaning may be something very different from the English "gods". In one language, the plural form of God, meant "God and those who follow him" and was an appropriate way to translate "saints".) (See "God" in KBT.)
\bttq To what did Jesus compare the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles?
\tqe Jesus compared receiving the Holy Spirit to being baptized with water by John the Baptist. (4-5)
\bttq What do you think happens when someone is baptized?
\tqe Key Term Check: In ordinary language the Greek verb baptizô (and related words) had both literal and figurative uses. The literal sense of baptizô was "to plunge or drench or immerse something", usually in water. In religious contexts, however, it came to have two more specific senses: 
\an (a) To wash someone or something in or with water to make him or it ceremonially clean.
\an (b) To wash someone in or with water as part of their initiation into the religious community. When a person is baptized he is showing publicly his commitment to and union with Jesus Christ. (See "baptize, baptism" in KBT.)
\bttq Can you think of a reason for which Jesus implied that when the apostles received the Holy Spirit, it was going to be like when John baptized them?
\tqe In both cases, what the apostles received was a sign that they were beginning a new way of life. (5)
\an (Note: The fact that Jesus used the word "baptize" for both events implies that they are/were similar.)

\bttq What did Jesus say to the apostles when they asked this question?
\tqe Jesus did not tell the apostles when the kingdom would be given back to the people of Israel. He said that his Father had set the time at which that would happen. (7)

\bttq What happened immediately after Jesus said that?
\tqe The apostles saw Jesus rise up into the air. Then a cloud covered him and he had completely disappeared. (9)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that the apostles kept looking up into the sky where Jesus was taken up into heaven [by God]?

\tqe There were about one hundred and twenty believers in that group. (15)
\bttq What did Peter say about the fact that Judas Iscariot had betrayed Jesus?
\tqe He said that a long time previously David had foretold that someone would betray a close companion or friend. David had been guided by the Holy Spirit to write that in the Scriptures. (16)
\bttq To what do you think the writer of this book was referring as "scripture"?
\tqe Key Term Check: The scriptures are the contents of the Old Testament as God gave them to men to write down. (See "scripture" in KBT.)

\bttq What did the people, who lived in Jerusalem, call the field in which Judas died?
\tqe In the language that they spoke, they called it Akeldama, which means Field of Blood. (19)
\bttq From which part of the Old Testament did Peter quote?
\tqe Peter quoted from one of the Psalms. (20)
\bttq What is the meaning of the first part of the Psalm from which Peter quoted?
\tqe That part of the Psalm means that the house of the person referred to would be deserted. No one would live there any more. (20)
\bttq What is the meaning of the second part of the quotation?
\tqe It means that someone else would do the work that the other person had done. (20)
\bttq How did Peter apply each of these quotations to Judas?
\tqe Since Judas was dead, it was necessary for Peter and the other apostles to choose someone else to be an apostle of Jesus. (21)
\bttq What did Peter say would be required of any believer to be chosen as an apostle to replace Judas? [Your answer should include two points.]
\tqe He must be a man who was a witness of the fact that Jesus had risen from death.
\tqe He must have been a man who kept company with Jesus from the time that John the Baptist was baptizing people until Jesus was taken up [by God] to heaven. (21-22)
\bttq Which of these requirements did Judas Iscariot not meet?
\tqe Because Judas killed himself, he was not a witness of the resurrection of Jesus. Also Judas had not been present when the other apostles saw Jesus going up to heaven. (18,21-22)
\bttq What were the names of the two men who [the believers] nominated as people who might be able to replace Judas Iscariot?
\tqe The two men whose names they suggested were Joseph, also known as Barsabbas or as Justus, and Matthias. (23)
\bttq The believers did two things to find out which of the two men should become an apostle. What two things did they do?
\tqe They prayed that God would show them which man he chose, 
\tqe and after that they cast lots. (24,26)
\an (Note: Casting lots was the usual way in that culture to decide certain kinds of questions. When they prayed, they were probably asking God to cause the lot to come out for the man that he would choose to be an apostle.)
\bttq The believers then prayed and said that Judas had abandoned his position as an apostle of Jesus. What else did they say about Judas, and what did that mean?
\tqe They said that Judas had left [his position of being an apostle and died] to go where he belonged. (25)
\bttq Which of the two men who [the believers] had named was chosen to be an apostle?
\tqe The name of Matthias was chosen, so he joined the other eleven apostles. (26)
\an (Note: The method people used at that time to cast lots was to put objects with names on them into a container. Then someone would shake the container until one of the objects fell out of it. The name on that object was considered to show which person was chosen.)

\bttq What did Peter say about the prophet Joel?
\tqe Peter said that the prophet Joel had predicted the unusual things that were happening on that day. That is, Joel had said that God would send his Spirit upon many people. (16-17)

\bttq When would these "signs" and "wonders" happen?
\tqe These things would happen before the time which Joel called "the day of the Lord." (20b)
\bttq What did Joel mean by "the day of the Lord"?
\tqe "The day of the Lord" means the time when God will judge all people for what they have done while they lived on earth. (20b)
\bttq When would these events about which Joel prophesied take place [in relation to the "day of the Lord"]?
\tqe All of the events that Peter mentioned in what he quoted from the prophet Joel would take place before the "day of the Lord." They would happen before the time when God judges people for what they have done. (20b)

\tqe Joel also said that before the "day of the Lord," everyone who calls on the name of the Lord would be saved by him/the Lord would save everyone who calls upon his name. (21)
\bttq What does it mean to you to have someone as your lord?
\tqe Key Term Check: A lord is someone who has power and exercises it responsibly. To call someone your lord means that you have given him control over your life. The Lord in this case is Jesus.

\tqe Key Term Check: A miracle is an unusual event that can only be explained as a special action by God. (See "miracle" in KBT.)
\bttq Whom did Peter say had caused Jesus to be killed?
\tqe Peter said that the Jews used the help of godless men to have Jesus killed by nailing him to a cross. (23b)
\bttq What do you know about the cross?
\tqe Key Term Check: The cross was constructed of two pieces of wood. One piece was a thick wooden post, which was placed/planted upright into a hole in the ground. The other piece was the crossbeam, which was fastened across the upright post so that it formed a + or T shape. (See "cross" in KBT.)
\bttq What else did Peter say about the death of Jesus?

\bttq In the verses which Peter quoted, to whom does the phrase "the Lord" refer?
\tqe In these verses "the Lord" refers to God the Father. (25-28)

\tqe David wrote as though a person called the "Holy One" was speaking to God the Father. (25-28)
\bttq To whom does the phrase "your Holy One" refer?
\tqe It is referring to the Messiah. (27)
\an (Note: See Mark 1:24b, John 6:69.)
\bttq In what part of these verses was David clearly not speaking about himself?
\tqe When David said, "because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay," he was not speaking about himself. (27)
\bttq What did Peter mention to prove that David was not speaking about himself as the Lord's "Holy One"?
\tqe Peter said that David had died and his body had been buried [by the people]. Everyone knew that because David's tomb was in Jerusalem. (29)
\bttq How was it possible for David to write something that would be true of the Messiah?
\tqe David was a prophet, and therefore the Holy Spirit enabled him to speak about what would happen to the Messiah. (30)
\an (Note: The Messiah would come into the world many centuries after David had died.)
\bttq What promise had God made to David that Peter referred to in this address?
\tqe God had promised David that one of his descendants would be a king, just as David was. (30)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that it was necessary that God should raise Jesus to life again?
\tqe The Jews believed that if Jesus had remained dead, that would have proved that he was not the Messiah. (31-32a)
\an (Note: Many Jews knew that in certain parts of the Old Testament, God had promised that the Messiah would live forever. Some of the Jews asked Jesus whether this was not true. See John 12:34.)
\bttq When Peter said, "we are all witnesses to this fact," to whom did Peter refer?
\tqe Peter referred at least to himself and the other eleven apostles. Some of the other believers who were included in the 120 mentioned in 1:15 may also have seen Jesus after he had risen from death. (32)
\an (Note: See 1 Corinthians 15:6.)
\bttq After stating that Jesus had truly come alive again and had been seen by many witnesses, Peter said two other things about Christ. What did he say about him?
\tqe Peter said that God the Father had placed Jesus at his right side in heaven. This gave Jesus authority to rule along with his Father. (33)
\bttq Peter included a statement about God the Father and one about the Holy Spirit. What did he say about each of these Persons?
\tqe Peter said that God the Father had promised that he would send the Holy Spirit to those who believed in Jesus.
\tqe The Father gave Jesus the Holy Spirit, authorizing him to send the Holy Spirit down upon the believers. This fulfilled the word about Jesus that John the Baptist had told his followers. (33)
\an (Note: See Luke 3:16.)
\bttq What reason did Peter state for the unusual things that the believers were doing at that time?
\tqe Peter said that the unusual sights and sounds were caused by the Holy Spirit controlling, or "filling," the believers.
\tqe It was the Spirit who sent down what appeared to be tongues of fire that rested upon the believers' heads. It was also the Spirit who caused them to speak clearly and understandably in languages they had never learned. (33b)
\bttq What did Peter say about David in the Psalm from which he quoted?
\tqe Peter pointed out that David could not have been speaking about himself, because David had not ascended into heaven. (34b-35)
\bttq In the verses that Peter quoted from the Psalm, whom did David say spoke, and to whom did that person speak?
\tqe David wrote that a person whom he described as "The Lord" spoke to another person, whom David described as "my Lord." When David said "The Lord," he meant God the Father.

\bttq How did believers who had many possessions share with those who were in need?

\bttq What is the reason that Gamaliel told them to let the apostles go free?
\tqe Gamaliel said that if only men had planned what the apostles were doing, the work of the apostles would fail, [like the work of Theudas and Judas the Galilean]. (38)
\tqe If God had planned the work that the apostles were doing, it was bound to succeed. (39)

\an Luke made it clear that the church took care of the widows who had no one to provide for them. The apostles were doing this work of caring for the widows.

\bttq What qualifications did the apostles say these men needed to have?

\tqe Key Term Check: A synagogue is a building or place of assembly used by Jewish communities primarily for religious worship. (See "synagogue" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that they opposed the teaching of Stephen?
\an (Note: They argued with him because they did not believe the message about Jesus that he preached. They may have been angry because a large number of Jewish priests had joined the people who believed that Jesus was the Christ.) (9)
\bttq What is the reason that the men from the "Synagogue of the Freedmen" were not able to win out over Stephen/prove that Stephen was wrong when they argued with him?

\oh Overview
\tqref ACT 7.1-53
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Stephen gave a summary of the history of the Israelites instead of just telling the members of the Sanhedrin that the accusations against him were false?
\an (Note: In giving a summary of the history of the Israelites, Stephen showed that he believed in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and respected the Law of Moses. He pointed out that the religious rulers of his time had rejected what God was offering them, just as their ancestors had.)

\bttq How do you think it happened that there was grain in Egypt, even during the years of famine?
\an (Note: Because God had given Joseph unusual wisdom, Joseph had caused the people of Egypt to store up their extra grain during years when there were good crops. So when the famine years came, there was grain in Egypt.)
\bttq How many times did Joseph's brother go to Egypt to buy grain?
\tqe Joseph's brothers went to Egypt twice and bought grain. Then they took the grain back to Canaan. (13)

\tqref ACT 7.20-53
\bttq What do you think is the reason that the parents of Moses cared for him inside their home for only three months?
\an (Note: After Moses was more than three months old, it was impossible for his parents to hide the fact that they had a baby in their home. Someone who served Pharaoh would have told Pharaoh that a Hebrew couple were hiding a baby boy, and Moses would have been taken away from them and killed.) (20)

\tqe and he was a strong, energetic man who could express himself well. (22)
\bttq Although Moses was brought up in the household of the king of Egypt, he knew that he was an Israelite. How do you think he knew that?
\an (Note: When Moses was still small enough to need a lot of personal care, his mother cared for him. When he grew into a boy and then into a man, no doubt his parents continued to visit him and talk with him, and to have him visit them. So he knew he was an Israelite, even though he had been taught and trained like an Egyptian child.) (23)
\bttq What did Moses do one day when he was forty years old?
\tqe One day when Moses was forty years old, he went to where the Israelites [were working as slaves. He wanted to see what was happening]. (23)

\tqe He saw an Egyptian hurting an Israelite, [probably a man who was working for him]. So he hit the Egyptian with such force that he killed him. (24)
\bttq What was the reason that Moses was not afraid to punish the Egyptian whom he saw mistreating an Israelite?
\tqe Moses thought that the Israelites would understand that God had sent him to set them free [from the Egyptians]. (25)
\bttq Those Israelites saw Moses kill the Egyptian. How did they feel about what he had done?
\an (Note: The Israelites did not understand that Moses was trying to help them. They were afraid of him because he had suddenly killed one of the people for whom they were working.) (27-28)
\bttq What happened that made Moses suddenly leave Egypt and go to Midian?
\tqe The day after Moses had killed the Egyptian, he tried to separate two Israelites who were fighting. One of them said to him, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you going to kill me, the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday?" (27-28)
\bttq What did Moses do in Midian?

\bttq What was the reason that the people of Jerusalem and their rulers demanded that Jesus be killed [by people], even though they had heard those prophecies about the Messiah many times?
\tqe They demanded that Jesus be killed, because they did not recognize that Jesus [was the Messiah about whom the prophets had written]. (27)

\bttq What was the most important fact that Paul told the people in the synagogue about Jesus?

\tqe But, when the [leaders of the] Jews, [who had rejected that message], saw how many people had gathered to hear Paul and Barnabas, they were jealous.

\bttq How did Paul and Barnabas reply to the Jews who spoke against them and tried to keep people from believing the message about the Lord Jesus?
\tqe They told those Jews that it had been necessary to tell them the message from God [about Jesus] before they told it to the Gentiles.

\tqe What Peter had just told about the conversion of Gentiles fulfilled that prophecy. (13-18)
\bttq What advice did James give concerning the Gentiles who were turning to the true God?
\tqe James advised that the Gentiles who were now worshipping God should not be required to keep all of the Law of Moses.
\tqe There were just four things/practices [which Moses had] written in the Law that he believed the Gentiles should no longer do when they became Christians. (19-20)
\bttq What were these four things/practices?
\tqe Gentiles who became Christians were to be advised not to eat food that had been offered to idols.
\tqe They were not to have a sexual relationship with any person except the one/husband or wife to whom they were married.
\tqe They were not to eat the meat of any animal that had been killed without draining its blood.
\tqe They were not to eat or drink the animal's blood. (20)
\bttq What is the reason that James said that Gentiles who became Christians should avoid those four practices?
\tqe James said that the Law of Moses prohibited those four practices, as well as many others. Many Gentiles attended the Jewish synagogue before they believed in the true God and in his Son, Jesus.
\tqe They had heard the Law of Moses read many times.
\tqe Therefore, it would please the Jews if the Gentiles who became believers in Jesus Christ would observe/obey those parts of the Mosaic Law. (21)

\dh Details

\tqe Certain of the people whom Paul met in the marketplace were teachers whom people called "philosophers."
\tqe They thought that Paul had some strange beliefs, and they did not think that what Paul said was important.
\tqe Other philosophers who talked with Paul decided that he must be trying to teach them about gods whom people in some other place worshipped. (18)

\bttq What did Paul next tell the people about the true God?
\tqe Paul told them that we ought not to think that [the true] God is anything like the images of gold, silver, or stone which people worship.
\tqe Because God has created made us to be like him, we know that he/God is not like any gods which people make. (29)
\bttq When God judges the people of the world, for what sin/offense will he judge them?
\tqe Paul implied that it is wrong/sin for people to worship idols.
\tqe In past times, people had worshipped idols because they did not know God.
\tqe Because they did not know him/God, he/God had not punished them.
\tqe But now, God was commanding people everywhere to repent and stop doing evil.
\tqe On a certain day, God was going to judge all people for the evil things that they have done. (29-31)
\bttq What do you think it means for a person to judge someone?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means someone/a judge will determine if a person is guilty or not of committing a crime. He does this by assessing the evidence connected to the person and what he may have done. (See "judge" in KBT.)

(Or, if it can be pluralised, the meaning may be something very different from the English "gods".

\bttq Tell me the main events recorded in this passage. (If necessary, prompt with: What was the world like? What happened on each day/of the days?)
\tqe At first, the world was empty/formless/unordered and dark. Then, God spoke and made light; and he separated day from night - which was what happened on the first day.

With this,/At this time, his (work of) creating was finished. On the seventh day, God rested.
\bttq Since God is the one who made the world and the animals and people, then who made God?
\an (Note: Nobody made God. He has always existed - He never had a beginning.) (See "God" in KBT.)
\bttq As you read/heard this passage, did you think the author wrote it/was writing mostly for children? Or did he write it mainly for adults?

\tqe The world had no form; there was nothing on the earth; it was dark. (2)
\bttq What was hovering above the waters?
\tqe The Spirit of God/The Power of God was hovering above the waters. (2)
\tqe Key Term Check: If the translation has "Spirit of God" here (rather than "Power of God"), be sure/ensure that the one who answers does not think that this refers to a being who is different/distinct from God (as referred to in 1:1). (See "Spirit of God" under "spirit" in KBT 2.b.)

\tqe Key Term Check: The concept "bless" occurs frequently and with different meanings. In this case, it refers to God granting his approval and his desire to see the birds and sea creatures prosper or do well. And in "blessing" the birds and sea creatures, God also gave to them the power to propagate/to pass on the gift of life that they have received from God. (See "bless" in KBT A.1.)

\bttq After God formed man from the dust/soil, what did God do to cause him to live/become alive?
\tqe He breathed into the man the breath that caused him to live. (7)
\tqe Key Term Check: The Hebrew text at Genesis 2:4 introduces the compound term, "Yahweh Elohim" in referring to God. If the translation uses a different term here than in the preceding sections, it is important to ensure that the readers/hearers do not think that the different term refers to a different God/being. (See "God" in KBT.)
\tqref GEN 2.8-9

\bttq After God had made the woman, what did he do with her?
\tqe He took/brought her to the man. (22)
\tqref GEN 2.23-25
\bttq What is the reason that the man called his partner "woman"?
\tqe The word "woman" means "from man." Because she was made from him/from part of him/from one of his ribs, he called her "woman". (23)
\bttq When a man separates from his parents and unites with a wife, to what event does that refer?

\bttq Tell me the main events/points/happenings in this account/passage.
\tqe The serpent persuaded the woman to eat some fruit from the tree - the one which would enable someone to know good and evil. Then the woman also persuaded the man to eat some of the fruit from that tree. Then they were both ashamed. When God came to (visit/see) them, the man blamed the woman, and the woman blamed the serpent. Then God put a curse on the serpent, and also on the woman, and on the man. (The curse applies to all of their descendents.)

\tqe According to her, God said that they would die. (3)
\tqref GEN 3.4-7
\bttq What was the serpent's answer to the woman?

\bttq As the woman looked at the fruit, what did she think about it?
\tqe She thought that it looked very good, and that it was probably delicious, and that it would make her wise. (6)

\tqe She picked some of the forbidden fruit(s), and she ate it/them. (6)
\bttq What else did the woman do?
\tqe She gave some of that fruit to her husband, and he ate it/them, too. (6)
\bttq What happened immediately after they ate the fruit(s)?
\tqe They felt shame about being naked/They were ashamed because they were naked, so they made coverings for themselves from leaves. (7)
\tqref GEN 3.8-13

\tqe They hid from him among the trees. (8)
\bttq Then what did God do?
\tqe He called (out) to the man, "Where are you?" (9)

\tqe Key Term Check: In pronouncing punishment here, God had cursed the serpent. In this context, "curse" is the opposite of "bless." (See "bless" in KBT.)
\bttq In the future, what will the serpent do to the woman's offspring/descendent(s)?
\tqe The snake will strike at his/their heel. (15)

\tqe The woman's descendent(s) will crush the snake's head. (15)
\an (Note: This probably means that the Christ will destroy Satan. This interpretation is not clear from this passage alone.)
\bttq What new/different experience did God say that the woman would have from that time on?
\tqe God said that the woman would have/experience great pain when she gives birth to a child. He also said that she would desire her husband/that she would desire to rule over her husband, but that her husband would rule over her. (16)

\tqref GEN 3.20-21
\bttq What name did Adam give to his wife?
\tqe He called her "Eve." (20)
\bttq For what reason did he choose that name for her?
\tqe That name means "life," and she would be the mother/ancestor of everyone born after that. (20)
\bttq What did God do for Adam and his wife at that time?
\tqe He made them clothing from the skins of animals. (21)
\tqref GEN 3.22-24
\bttq What do you think would be the situation of mankind, if people had been allowed/permitted to continue to eat fruit from the tree that gave/gives life?
\tqe People might have lived forever (in the state of knowing good and evil). (22)
\bttq At first, Adam and Eve were allowed to eat fruit from the tree that gives life, and they would not die. Why do you think it was no longer good for mankind to live forever?
\tqe It was no longer good because we/they are now spiritually dead. We/they have experienced both good and evil. (22)
\bttq Therefore, what did God do so that people were no longer able to eat fruit from the tree that gave/gives life?

\bttq Whom did God expel/send away from the Garden of Eden?
\tqe He sent out both Adam and Eve. -OR- He sent out Adam, and his wife accompanied him. (23)

\tqe He was to work/cultivate the soil. (23)
\bttq The cherubim/watchers which God placed at the gate - what do you think they were like?
\an (Note: We do not know about their appearance. They were probably strong and powerful. Nobody could persuade the cherubim/watchers to allow them to return to the Garden.)
\tqe Key Term Check: The beings whom God placed to guard the gate to Eden were called "cherubim", the plural form of "cherub". A cherub is a supernatural being. It might belong to a subclass of angelic beings, or it might be something similar to an angel. (See "angel" in KBT.)
\bttq What was the reason that God placed the cherubim at the gate?
\tqe God placed the cherubim there to keep anyone from entering the Garden (and thus being able to eat fruit from the tree that gave/gives life). (24)
\bttq What do you think about that serpent which tempted Eve and Adam - do you think that it was just a snake?
\tqe No, it was really Satan (who is the leader of evil spirits).
\an (Note: Probably "the serpent" was really Satan. However, the author does not state this, and one who is reading/hearing this passage and is not familiar with the rest of the Bible might not be able to identify the serpent as being Satan.)

\tqe They gave some of the increase from their work as a gift to God. (3-4)
\tqe Key Term Check: This is the first of many occasions in Scripture where someone brings an offering to God. In some languages, it may be necessary to use a different term for Cain's offering of farm produce from that used for Abel's offering of an animal. (See "sacrifice, offering" in KBT.)

God also warned Cain that he (Cain) must be careful, because the desire to rebel against God is like an enemy/a wild animal who wanted/wants to destroy him, and that Cain must seek to overcome that desire. (6-7)
\bttq What do you understand is meant by "sin"? // What do you understand "sin" to be?

\bttq What was God's answer to Cain?
\tqe God/He said that, no, people would not kill him. God/He said that, if someone did kill Cain/him, then God would punish the killer seven times more/harder than he had punished Cain. -OR- God said, "No, people will not kill you. If someone does (try to) kill you, I will punish that killer/him seven times harder than I have punished you." (15)
\bttq And then what else did God do to protect Cain?
\tqe God/He put a mark/sign on Cain to warn anyone who might try to kill him/Cain. (15)
\bttq Then what did Cain do?
\tqe He left God's presence and went to the land of Nod, which is east of Eden. (16)

\bttq What did Lamech say about anyone who might try to harm him?
\tqe He said that such a person would be punished 77 times. (24)
\bttq What was the name of the third son of Adam and Eve? For what reason was he named that?

\dh Details
\tqref GEN 8.1-5
\bttq In the first verse, what do we learn about God caring for those in the large boat?
\tqe We learn that God had not forgotten them. He thought about them, and he sent a wind to begin to dry the earth. (1)

\an (Note: God, of course, had not destroyed all living things - he saved Noah and his family, and pairs of all the animals and birds.

\bttq What do you think was the work of a priest?
\tqe Key Term Check: During the time of the Old Testament, people understood that they could not simply approach God on their own. A priest was a "go-between" or mediator between people and God. A priest would offer sacrifices to God on behalf of God's people. A priest would also burn incense, offer prayers, and lead the people in worshipping God. (See "priest" in KBT.)
\bttq We learn that Melchizedek brought Abram food and drink/bread and wine. What else did Melchizedek do for Abram?
\tqe Melchizedek also blessed Abram/asked God to do good for Abram. (19)
\tqe Key Term Check: On several previous occasions, God has blessed people or animals (Genesis 1:22, 28; 5:2; 9:1; 12:2-3). In this passage/section the author wrote that Melchizedek blessed Abram. It was not that Melchizedek did the same thing that God had done - rather, in this passage Melchizedek asked God to do good for/bless Abram. (See "bless" in KBT.)

\tqe Abram said that he had promised (to) God that he would not accept any wealth from the king of Sodom. (22-23)
\bttq What was the reason that Abram gave for not wanting to receive anything from the king of Sodom?
\tqe Abram said that if he did receive something from the king of Sodom, then the king could say that he was the one who made Abram wealthy. (23)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Abram did not want the king of Sodom to be able to say that he was the one who made Abram wealthy?
\tqe Perhaps it was because the people Sodom were especially evil. (13:10,13) Or perhaps Abram simply did not want any person to claim that they were the ones who made Abram wealthy - that it was God who had made Abram wealthy.
\bttq What was Abram willing to accept from the king of Sodom?
\tqe Abram was willing to accept the food that his men had already eaten, and also the share of the booty/goods to which his allies were entitled. (24)

\tqe Sarai, Abram's wife, had so far been unable to bear Abram a child. So she gave to Abram her servant, an Egyptian woman named Hagar, to bear a child for Abram. Hagar became pregnant, and then became disrespectful to Sarai. So Sarai made life miserable for Hagar, and Hagar then fled/ran away. An angel met Hagar, and told her to return to Abram.

\tqe She became very upset with Hagar. (5)
\bttq According to Sarai, who was at fault?
\tqe She blamed Abram. // She said that Abram was at fault.
\tqe Key Term Check: Sarai said in this account/passage that God should examine her and Abram, and that God should decide/pass judgment concerning who was at fault. It is possible that Sarai was simply expressing her displeasure and was not sincerely calling on God to pass judgment. However, many translations might use here the same term that is used elsewhere to refer specifically to God's judgment. (See "judge, judgment" in KBT.)

\tqe Key Term Check: There are about 56 references in the NIV OT and NT to "the Angel of the LORD", "the Angel of God", and "the Angel of the Lord".

\bttq Instead of Lot sending out/giving his two visitors to the men of Sodom, what did he suggest to the crowd?
\tqe Lot said that he would give to the crowd his two maiden daughters instead. (8)
\bttq What do you think was the reason why Lot offered his two daughters to the crowd, instead of sending out/giving up his visitors?
\tqe It would seem that, in Lot's mind, it was worse for his visitors to be raped/violated than for the same to happen to his daughters.
\tqref GEN 19.9-14
\bttq After Lot begged the crowd not to harm his guests, what was the crowd's response?
\tqe The crowd ordered Lot to stand aside/get out of the way, and they threatened to treat him worse than they would treat the visitors. They crowded in on Lot, nearly pushing the door down. (9)

\bttq What did Lot's two visitors instruct him to do?

\bttq To whom did Lot go to warn that Sodom was about to be destroyed?
\tqe Lot went to warn two men who were about/planning to marry his daughters. (14)

\tqe God is merciful. (16)
\tqe Key Term Check: God was not obligated to save Lot and his family (from destruction), especially since Lot was not willing to obey the angels and leave Sodom. But God showed mercy or compassion in removing Lot and thus saving him. (See "mercy" in KBT.)

\bttq What did Lot admit that the angels were doing for him?
\tqe Lot admitted that the angels were (being) kind/merciful to save him. (19)
\tqe Key Term Check: In this situation, Lot was probably not referring to being saved from eternal punishment, but rather he meant that the angels were delivering him from certain death, as Sodom was about to be destroyed. Some languages may use one term to refer to saving someone from death, and a different term to refer to saving someone from eternal punishment. (See "save" in KBT.)
\bttq So what did Lot suggest that he and his family do, instead of fleeing all the way to the mountains?
\tqe Lot suggested that he and his family take shelter in a small nearby town/city. (20)

\tqe He urged them to hurry. (22)
\bttq What did the angel say was the reason why Lot and his family must hurry?

\bttq When Lot's wife looked back, what happened to her?
\tqe She became like a statue made of salt. (26)

\tqe Abraham was Lot's uncle.
\bttq What did Abraham see?
\tqe Abraham saw thick smoke above the land, like a huge cooking/smoking fire/like smoke from a furnace. (28)

(It is not clear whether/that Lot, his wife, and their two daughters were "righteous/innocent" people. But probably they were, at least, not as evil as the rest of the people who were destroyed.)

\tqe Jacob said that he would give Esau some food, but only if Esau would give Jacob his (Esau's) birthright - that is, Esau's rights as first-born son. (31)
\bttq In your opinion, what do you think Esau was entitled to as the firstborn son?
\tqe At that time, it meant that Esau would inherit twice as much as his younger brother, Jacob.

Jacob was worried that his father would discover that he was pretending to be Esau, but Rebekah told him that she would take care of everything. So Esau went off hunting, and Jacob went out and got two goats. His mother cooked/prepared the goats, and also she put some of the goat skin on Jacob's skin/arms to make him hairy like his brother.

\bttq When the drink-server/cup-bearer said that he remembered his sins/failure/wrong, to what do you think he was referring?
\tqe He might have been referring to what he had done which resulted in Pharaoh putting him in prison. Or he might have been thinking of Joseph's request to tell Pharaoh about him (Joseph). Or he might have been thinking about both of those events. (9)

\tqe He said that Pharaoh had put him in prison, along with the chief baker. And that one night, each of them had had a dream.

\bttq What does this suggest about Joseph's character?
\tqe It shows that he trusted (in) God, and that he was humble. He did not want anyone to think that he (Joseph) had powers or abilities which he did not truly have in himself.
\bttq What did Pharaoh say about the thin cows when he first saw them in his dream?
\tqe He said that they were thin and very ugly - that he had never seen such ugly cows in all of Egypt. (19)

\tqe They represented seven years of abundance/prosperity, with very good crops. (26)
\bttq What was the meaning of the seven thin cows and the seven thin/empty heads of grain?
\tqe They represented seven years of famine. (27)
\bttq Since Pharaoh had two dreams, did that mean that there would be two times of abundance, and that there would also be two times of famine?
\tqe No, both of the dreams referred to (the) one time of abundance followed by (the) one seven-year famine. (25-26)
\bttq What did Joseph say about how serious the famine would be?
\tqe He said that the famine would be so severe that people would forget about the seven years of abundance. (30-31)
\bttq (Then) what is the significance of Pharaoh having two dreams (rather than only one dream)?
\tqe God was showing that it would truly happen and that it would be soon. (32)
\bttq Was God revealing things about which he (God) knew, but over which he had no control? Or did God have control over those times of abundance and times of famine?
\tqe God not only knew about what would happen, but he also had control over all the events/happenings. (25,28,32)
\bttq Do you remember when Joseph dreamt while he was a boy in Canaan? Can you see anything similar between Joseph's experience then and Pharaoh's experience at this time?

\bttq What did Pharaoh mean when he said that no one would move a hand or a foot in the entire land of Egypt without Joseph's approval? Does this mean (literally) that every person must request permission from Joseph to even move a hand or foot?

\tqe It had been 13 years. (Joseph was 17 years old (Genesis 37:2), when Jacob had sent him to check on his older brothers.)
\bttq From this story about Joseph, what lessons can we see about why God sometimes causes people to experience difficulty?
\tqe God uses suffering to test us and to change us. He is always in control of the circumstances that affect us, even though sometimes it may not appear as though God is in control.
\bttq As soon as Joseph left Pharaoh's palace, what did he do?
\tqe He traveled throughout the land of Egypt (probably in order to become familiar with the country and its resources). (46)
\bttq What were the crops like during the first seven years that Joseph was in charge?

\tqe When the people harvested grain, he had a portion of the grain stored in barns/granaries/warehouses in each town/city. (48)
\bttq Where did they store the grain?
\tqe They stored it in barns/granaries/warehouses in each town/city near where it grew. (48)
\bttq How much grain were they able to store?
\tqe They had so much that it filled all the storage places (until they overflowed) - so much that they could not account for all of it. (49)
\bttq What else happened during those years of abundant crops?
\tqe Joseph and his wife had two sons. (50)
\bttq What were the names of Joseph's sons?

\tqe God had helped Joseph not to feel angry or bitter regarding his brothers and his hard experiences. (51)
\bttq If someone wrongs us, do you think that we should remember what they did and take revenge, or should we forgive and forget the wrong that they did against us?
\tqe We should follow Joseph's example and forgive/forget.
\bttq What was the reason why Joseph named his second son "Ephraim"?
\tqe He gave him that name because it means "fruitful". And (just as a tree begins with nothing but later has fruit, so) Joseph began with nothing when he came to Egypt, but later he had achieved a high position of responsibility, and had a wife, and two sons. (52)

When they arrived, they had to go to Joseph to buy/get grain. They did not recognize him, but he recognized them. He accused the brothers of being foreign spies. They insisted that they were not spies, but rather were brothers who were in need of food. They mentioned that their father and youngest brother were still back in Canaan. Joseph told them that he would not believe them unless they brought their youngest brother to him. So he kept Simeon in jail, and sent the other nine brothers home to get/bring back Benjamin. When they arrived home, they found that the money that was to have been payment for the grain was in their grain sacks. They told Jacob about all that had happened. Jacob was very upset that now he had lost Simeon too (in addition to Joseph). So he said that he would not allow his nine sons/the brothers to take Benjamin back with them to Egypt, because he feared that Benjamin, too, would not return.

\tqref GEN 42.1-5
\bttq Who went to Egypt?
\tqe Joseph's ten older brothers went to Egypt. (3)
\bttq For what purpose did they go to Egypt?
\tqe There was famine in Canaan, but there was food in Egypt. Jacob's family had little or no food to eat, so Jacob sent ten of his sons to Egypt in order to buy food. (1-3)
\bttq According to Jacob, what would happen to their family, if his sons did not go to Egypt to buy food?
\tqe They would starve (to death). (2)
\bttq What is the reason that Benjamin did not accompany his brothers?
\tqe He stayed with his father, because (Jacob thought that) he was the only child of Rachel who was still living, and Jacob feared that something bad/harmful might happen to him. (4)
\bttq Were other foreigners also going to Egypt in order to buy food?
\tqe Yes, other foreigners were going to Egypt, because the famine had spread beyond Egypt. (5)
\tqref GEN 42.6-17
\bttq What was Joseph's government/political position at that time?
\tqe He was governor/master/ruler in Egypt. Only Pharaoh had more power/authority than Joseph.
\bttq What were the circumstances which caused Joseph's brothers to go to see Joseph himself?
\tqe They happened to go to Joseph because he was responsible for selling grain. (6)
\bttq When Joseph and his brothers met, what did his brothers do?
\tqe The brothers bowed to the ground in front of Joseph. (6)
\bttq What did Joseph do at that time?
\tqe He recognized his brothers, but he pretended that he did not recognize them. And he questioned them roughly concerning where they had come from. (7)
\bttq What do you think prevented Joseph's brothers from recognizing him?
\tqe At that time, Joseph was 30 years old, and they had not seen him since he was 17 years old. Also, he was wearing Egyptian clothes, and was using his Egyptian name, and he was a very high official. (41:14,42,45-46; 42:8)
\bttq What do you think might have caused Joseph to remember what he had dreamt so many years ago?
\tqe Perhaps it was because his brothers bowed to him. (6,9)
\bttq What did Joseph say was his brothers' purpose in coming to Egypt?
\tqe He said that they were spies, that they wanted to see if it would be easy to conquer the land of Egypt. (9)
\bttq Do you think that Joseph truly supposed that those men were spies?
\tqe No, he did not. (He was probably testing them.)
\bttq When Joseph said that they were spies, how did they respond?
\tqe They said that they had come only to buy food, and that they were honest/truthful men. They added that they were all brothers, and were not spies. (10-11)
\bttq What did Joseph reply?
\tqe He repeated his earlier claim that the men had come to see if it would be easy to conquer the land of Egypt. (12)
\bttq So what did the brothers say then?
\tqe They explained that they were all the sons of one father, and that their father and one younger brother were still living in Canaan. (13)
\bttq Who was the younger brother whom they mentioned?
\tqe That was Benjamin. (13)
\bttq Did the brothers say anything about their brother, Joseph?
\tqe Yes, they said that he was no longer with them/he was lost/he had died. (13)
\bttq At that time, what did Joseph demand that his brothers do in order to prove that what they said was really true?
\tqe Joseph said that one of the men must go home and then bring back their younger brother to him. Meanwhile, the other brothers must stay in jail in Egypt. (15)
\bttq According to Joseph, if the youngest brother does not come to him (Joseph) in Egypt, what would Joseph conclude about all the brothers?
\tqe He said that he would know that the men were spies. (16)
\bttq It seems as though Joseph did not trust his brothers. What was the reason that this might be the case?
\tqe His brothers had sold him as a slave, and had then lied about it to their father.
\bttq How many days were the brothers in prison?
\tqe They were in prison for three days. (17)
\bttq In your opinion, how do you think the brothers felt while they were in prison?
\tqe They were probably very afraid. Perhaps they considered that what was happening now was punishment/retribution for the cruel way that they had treated Joseph many years ago.
\tqref GEN 42.18-24
\bttq After the brothers had been in prison for 3 days, what happened?
\tqe Joseph went to them and told them that instead of sending one brother home to get/to bring back the youngest brother, he (Joseph) would keep only one brother in prison. All the others could return home. (19)
\bttq What did Joseph say was the reason why he showed mercy to them in that way?
\tqe He said that he feared/respected God. (18)
\bttq If someone fears/respects God, would you expect them to show mercy to other people?
\tqe Yes.
\bttq What did Joseph tell the brothers to do at this time?
\tqe They were to take food back (to Canaan), and then they were to return to Egypt bringing their youngest brother. (19,20)
\bttq What did Joseph say that he would do if the brothers brought back their youngest brother to Egypt?
\tqe Joseph told them that he would free the one brother (Simeon); he said that he would not execute them as spies. (20)
\bttq What did the brothers say about why they were experiencing those problems/difficulties?
\tqe They said that the problems/difficulties were payment/retribution/penalty for having been cruel to Joseph (many years ago). (21)
\bttq During that time, years ago, when they had put their brother Joseph in the pit/cistern, and then sold him to the traders, what reaction had they seen and heard from Joseph?
\tqe They had seen him terrified, and had heard him pleading for mercy. (21)
\bttq And when they had seen and heard how he had reacted, what had they done?
\tqe They had still mistreated him. They ignored Joseph's cries for mercy and still sold him. (21)
\bttq So years later, as the brothers were in Egypt, what did Reuben say to the rest of his brothers?
\tqe He scolded/rebuked his brothers because they had not followed his advice/warnings years ago. (22)
\bttq According to Reuben, what would happen to the ten brothers?
\tqe He said that they would suffer retribution/revenge for having mistreated Joseph. (22)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that the brothers still remembered something that they did so long ago?
\tqe It is often difficult to forget sins. When we sin, there are consequences, and God will judge and punish those who have been cruel to others. (21-22)
\bttq Did Joseph understand what his brothers were saying?
\tqe Yes, Joseph could still understand the language that his family spoke. (23)
\bttq Did the brothers realize that Joseph was able to understand them?
\tqe No, they did not realize that. (23)

They did not understand what was happening and they were terrified. Meanwhile, Jacob was terribly upset because he had not only lost Joseph, but now it appeared that he had also lost Simeon. So he was not willing to risk sending Benjamin to Egypt.

\tqe He urged Jacob to send Benjamin along and he (Judah) would ensure Benjamin's safety. Judah pointed out that they needed more food, or else they and their families would all die. (8-9)
\bttq How do we know that a long time had passed since the brothers first returned home from Egypt?
\tqe Judah said that they could have made two more trips to and from Egypt, if they had returned immediately with Benjamin. (10)
\bttq What did Jacob decide at that time?
\tqe Jacob decided that he must allow Benjamin to go to Egypt. So he sent expensive gifts, and double the payment for the grain. (11-14)
\bttq For what reason do you think that Jacob sent double payment?
\tqe Probably he intended that his sons have enough money to pay for the grain from the first trip, as well as (for that which they would buy on) this second trip. (12)
\bttq What did Jacob say was possibly the reason that someone had placed the money in their (grain) sacks?
\tqe He said that someone might have made a mistake/oversight. (12)
\bttq Tell me about the gifts that Jacob had his sons take to Egypt.

Then Joseph fed them a special meal.
\dh Details
\tqref GEN 43.18-25
\bttq What do you think is the reason that the brothers were afraid to go to Joseph's home?
\tqe It was very unusual for someone in Joseph's high position to invite a group such as those to his home. The brothers tried to understand why this was happening. They supposed that someone might have reported that, when the brothers got grain the first time, they did not pay for it. And now Joseph might punish them as though they had stolen the grain. (18)
\bttq What did the brothers suppose that Joseph might do to them if he thought that/because they had not paid for the grain?
\tqe They were afraid that Joseph would make them his slaves and take their donkeys. (18)
\bttq What did the brothers do in order to try to solve the problem?
\tqe They talked to the man in charge of Joseph's household, and tried to pay again for the grain which they had received on the first trip. (19-22)
\bttq What was the steward's answer to them?
\tqe He told them not to be afraid. He said that the appropriate person/office had truly received the brothers' payment. And he told them that maybe God had put the money back into their grain sacks. (23)
\bttq After they spoke about the grain payment, what did Joseph's household manager do?
\tqe He released Simeon from jail and brought him to his brothers. (23b)
\bttq What did Joseph's servants do next?
\tqe They welcomed the brothers into Joseph's home, and gave them water to wash, and food for their donkeys. (24)
\bttq What did the brothers do while they waited for Joseph to come home?
\tqe They prepared the gifts that they had brought for him. (25)
\tqref GEN 43.26-34
\bttq When Joseph arrived (at) home, in what manner did the brothers greet him?
\tqe They brought their special gifts, and bowed low/bowed to the ground in front of him. (26)
\bttq What did Joseph ask them?
\tqe Joseph asked them how they were/if they were well. And he asked whether their father was still alive. (27)
\bttq What was the brothers' response?
\tqe They said that their father was (still) alive and well, and then they bowed again in front of Joseph. (28)
\bttq When the brothers bowed in front of Joseph, were they worshipping him as though he was God?
\tqe No, they were showing respect to him since he was a man of very high position.
\bttq When Joseph saw Benjamin, what did Joseph say?
\tqe Joseph asked God to bless Benjamin - to show favor or kindness to him. (29)
\bttq What happened next?
\tqe Joseph felt overwhelmed by his emotions, so he went quickly into his room to cry. (30)
\bttq Then what did Joseph do?
\tqe He washed his face (so that people no one would see that he was/felt upset), came out of his room, and ordered his servants to bring the food. (31)
\bttq Tell me about the seating arrangements for the meal.
\tqe Joseph sat alone, and his brothers ate together as a group, seated/arranged in order of their age. The Egyptians ate together, separated from Joseph and his brothers. (32)
\bttq What is the reason that the Egyptians did not eat/sit together with Joseph's brothers?
\tqe The Egyptians despised/looked down on the Hebrews. // The Egyptians considered the food of the Hebrews (as) taboo. (32)
\bttq What was it about the seating arrangements which caused Joseph's brothers to be very surprised?
\tqe Joseph/Joseph's servant had told the brothers where they were to sit. That seating arrangement was in order of age - from the eldest to the youngest. (33)
\bttq Tell me about the manner in which the brothers received their food.
\tqe Someone brought them their food from Joseph's table. And Benjamin received five times more food/much more food than his brothers. (34)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Joseph gave special treatment to Benjamin?
\tqe Perhaps he did this to honor Benjamin, since Benjamin was Joseph's only full-brother. (The others were Joseph's half-brothers.) Also, perhaps Joseph was testing his brothers to see if they would treat Benjamin in the same manner as they had treated Joseph when their father gave Joseph special treatment.
\bttq Do you think that the brothers were ashamed or afraid to eat or drink very much?
\tqe No, they ate and drank freely. (34)

\bttq After Joseph's brothers bought their grain and left for home, what happened?
\tqe The man in charge of Joseph's household chased after/pursued them and accused them of stealing a special cup from Joseph. The brothers denied it. The man searched their grain sacks and found the cup in Benjamin's sack. He said that Benjamin would have to stay in Egypt as a slave. The brothers all returned to Joseph, and Joseph again said that Benjamin would have to stay as his slave. Then Judah spoke up. He told Joseph that their father, Jacob, would die if Benjamin did not return (with them) to Canaan. And Judah offered to remain in Egypt as Joseph's slave in place of Benjamin.
\bttq What do you think might have been Joseph's purpose in all of this?
\tqe Probably he was testing his brothers. Perhaps Benjamin had taken Joseph's place as Jacob's favorite son. And if the other brothers had not changed, then they would use this opportunity to get rid of Benjamin - to cause him to become a slave in Egypt as had happened to Joseph years ago. But if the brothers were sorry for what they had done to Joseph - and to their father, Jacob - then perhaps at this time they would do anything they could to keep Benjamin from being enslaved, and to return him to his father in Canaan.

\bttq Did Joseph's servant agree with the brothers' suggestion for punishment?
\tqe He agreed in part. The servant said that whoever had the cup would become a slave, and the other brothers could go free. (10)
\bttq What did the brothers do next?
\tqe They quickly unloaded their grain sacks from the donkeys. (11)

\bttq In what way did Judah show a much greater concern for his father at this time, than he did years ago, when Joseph had gone to find his brothers in the fields?

\tqe Because they had become slow to understand/mentally lazy and not capable of grasping complicated ideas.
\tqref HEB 5.12
\bttq What does he say about the people he is writing to?
\tqe (1) They should be teaching others but instead they still have to be taught the first lessons they heard about God.

\tqe (2) They must trust in God (who can forgive their sins and cause them to live forever).

\tqe He was telling about people who cannot repent and now he is talking about a field.
\bttq Why? (or, the translator may need to ask what each part of the metaphor represents and "What does God do with a field/ground which produces well?")
\tqe It is the same with the people as it is with the ground. Their hearts are like the ground and God's Message is like the rain. When God has spoken to them they should become and live like people who are spiritually mature/adults in God's ways. When they do, God blesses them. But if they remain useless to him, they are in danger of being cursed by him and destroyed the same way useless weeds are burned.

\bttq It says, "if God allows." Why does it say that? Why wouldn't God allow them to go on to advanced lessons?

\an This comment may only mean the usual subordinating of everything to God's will. See commentaries.

\bttq What kind of system/what way do the earthly priests offer sacrifices?
\tqe According to the laws God gave Moses. (And Jesus offers according to the new system/way of worship.)

\oh Overview
\tqref HEB 9.1-5

\tqe This is a description of the place of worship that was part of that First Agreement God made with man.
\bttq Tell in your own words as much as you can remember.
\tqref HEB 9.1-2
\bttq What does this say about the First Agreement?
\tqe (1) It had rules which told men how they are to worship God.
\tqe (2) It had a place to worship that was suitable to worship here on earth.
\bttq What was it like? (or, What does it tell us about it?) (Follow with, "What else?" and reread as necessary. Continue through verse 5.)
\tqe (1) It was a tent.
\tqe (2) The tent had two rooms or compartments.
\tqe (3) The first room was called the Holy Place (place set apart for God).
\tqe (4) In that first room was a lamp and a table with bread set there as an offering/gift for God.
\tqe (5) A thick curtain separated the first and second rooms in the tent.
\tqe (6) That second room was called the Most Holy Place (Place where God lived).
\tqe (7) In front of the curtain was a gold table/altar where the priests burned incense.
\tqe (8) Inside the second room was a chest covered with gold inside and out.
\tqe (9) The chest was called the Chest of the Agreement.
\tqe (10) Inside the chest was a gold jar with a sample of the manna/food with which God fed the people in the desert, Aaron's rod that sprouted, grew leaves, etc., and the two flat pieces of stone with the commandments written on them.
\tqe (11) Above that chest were two images of the special angels that are always with God.
\tqe (12) Those angels are attached to the lid with their wings spread out over the chest where (the high priest placed the blood of a sacrificed animal once a year to show that) God forgave people's sins.
\bttq Is that all he said? (Yes.) Why didn't he tell us more?
\tqe He said there was not the time to explain everything in detail.
\dh Specifics
\bttq The translator probably needs to discuss the names of the two rooms, Holy Place and Most Holy Place to be sure they are appropriate and not misunderstood. Perhaps the question should be, "Why do you think they called the rooms by these names?" or, "If someone told you a room or place was called by that name, what kind of place would you think it would be?"
\bttq What is incense and why do you think they burned it there?
\tqe Reasonable answers. It represented prayer but few people would know that. They probably will only know it is part of the worship, but not know its function.
\bttq The translator should probably get the reader to describe how he thinks all these things looked, things like the Chest of the Agreement, stone tablets, etc.

\bttq Tell in your own words as much as you can remember.
\tqref HEB 9.6
\bttq What does it say about the priests?
\tqe They go in and out of the first room every day performing their duties.
\tqref HEB 9.7
\bttq What does it say about the second room? or the high priest?
\tqe The high priest goes in there once a year.
\bttq What does he do there? (or, Why/How does he go in?)
\tqe He takes blood from an animal just killed to offer to God to pay for his own sin and the sin of the people.
\tqref HEB 9.8
\bttq What does this say about the Holy Spirit?
\tqe It says he used the tent with its arrangement of furniture and rules of worship to show that the way into the inner room where God lived was not yet open (so that anyone could enter anytime).
\bttq What else does it say about the way being open?
\tqe It says it would not be open as long as the way to come to God/a system of worship was being used in which men and priests could come no closer to God than that first room.
\tqref HEB 9.9
\bttq What does it say about gifts and animal sacrifices? What do we learn from them?
\tqe It says the tent and that way of worship shows people that animal sacrifices and gifts are not sufficient to make them free from sin (and thus acceptable to enter into the presence of God).
\tqref HEB 9.10
\bttq What else does it say about that way of worship? (or, Why was it not adequate?)
\tqe The people only kept rules to please God, rules of what to eat and drink and various washing ceremonies to make people acceptable to take part in worship.
\bttq What else does it say about that way of worship? (or, If that way of worship was inadequate, why did they worship that way?)
\tqe God gave them that way of worship until the time he could change the system and give them a better way.
\dh Specifics
\bttq It says the High Priest took blood into the inner room once a year to pay for the sins of the people. Can you explain this a bit more? How was this blood supposed to pay for sin?
\tqe Be sure they have the idea that that blood was proof or evidence that an animal had died in their place to take the punishment for their sin.
\bttq What kind of sin was the blood supposed to pay for?
\tqe The general sinful nature of the people, not their specific sins.
\bttq It says the old way of worship showed that animal sacrifices and gifts were not sufficient to make people acceptable to God or not sufficient to make their hearts clean from sin. How did it show that? (see verse 8)
\tqe It showed it because, even after they sacrificed animals, they still could not go into that inner room where God lived.

\tqref HEB 9.11
\bttq What does this say about Christ?
\tqe He has come as their High Priest to give them a better way to worship God.

\tqref HEB 9.12
\bttq What does this say about Christ?
\tqe When he entered into that room where God lived, he did not take the blood of animals to offer as a payment for sin.
\bttq What did he take?
\tqe He took his own blood.
\bttq What else does it say about his going in there? How many times has he gone in?
\tqe He only did it once.
\bttq The other high priest had to go in every year. Why did he (Christ) only have to go in once? Why was his sacrifice not repeated?
\tqe The blood from his sacrifice of himself was enough to pay the price for God to rescue people from sin forever (and thus make them acceptable to enter into God's presence).
\tqref HEB 9.13
\bttq What does this say about goats and bulls?
\tqe It says the blood and ashes from those that were sacrificed was sprinkled on people who were ceremonially unclean/had done something to make them unacceptable to live and worship with the rest. This was done to make them clean/acceptable again.

\bttq What does it say about the blood of Christ?What does it say about the blood of Christ?
\tqe (1) If the blood of animals could do all that, how much more the blood of Christ can do for people.
\tqe (2) His blood (in contrast to the blood of animals) is enough to pay the price so that God can remove people's guilt from all the things that separate them from God so that they can now serve the God who lives forever or who gives life.
\bttq What else does it say about Christ? How was it possible for him to make such a sacrifice?
\tqe The Spirit of God who lives forever gave him the strength/power to offer himself to God as a perfect/without flaw sacrifice.

\tqe His blood (in contrast to the blood of animals) is enough to pay the price so that God can remove people's guilt from all the things that separate them from God so that they can now serve the God who lives forever or who gives life.
\bttq Why can his sacrifice do so much more than the sacrifice of animals? How was it possible for him to make such a sacrifice?
\tqe The Spirit of God who lives forever gave him the strength/power to offer himself to God as a perfect/without flaw sacrifice.
\tqref HEB 9.15
\bttq What does this say about Christ and the New Agreement?
\tqe It says because Christ's sacrifice was such a sufficient sacrifice, he has become the one to make the New Agreement valid/set it in operation.
\bttq So what does New Agreement do for people that the first one didn't?
\tqe It makes it possible for all those God has invited/called to be his people to have forever all the wonderful things God has promised them.
\bttq What about those people then who worshipped God according to the First Agreement (and only offered animals which were not sufficient to completely pay for their sins), how can God forgive their sins?
\tqe Christ died to pay the penalty for the sins of those people too.
\dh Specifics
\bttq It says Christ is serving as High Priest in heaven in a place of worship there. What else does it say about that place of worship?
\tqe It says it is not made by man, not even a part of this created world and that it is a perfect place, much greater than the place of worship here on earth.
\bttq Could you explain what you think verse 13 says?
\tqe Be sure they have some reasonable idea of what it means to be ceremonially unclean and that the ritual cleansing made them "clean" again.

\oh Overview
\tqref HEB 9.16-22
\bttq Briefly tell in your own words what the author said.
\tqe The Agreements God made with man were like the agreement people make to give someone something when they die (wills). The people cannot receive the things until after the person's death. (They are not valid until there is a death.) It was that way with that First Agreement God made with Moses.

\tqref HEB 9.16-17

\bttq What else does it say about the death of the person who made the will? (or, What has to happen before the person can receive the other's possessions~besides the death of the owner?)
\tqe His death must be proven.
\tqref HEB 9.18
\bttq What does this say about the First Agreement God made with man/Moses?
\tqe It is like the agreement a person makes to give his possessions to someone when he dies (a will).
\bttq How was it like that kind of agreement?
\tqe A death must be proven by the use of the blood from the one who died. Otherwise the agreement is no good.
\tqref HEB 9.19-20
\bttq In the case of the First Agreement, who had to die?
\tqe Animals, calves.
\bttq What did Moses do with the blood?
\tqe First he read the terms of the Agreement, the rules about how the people were to live and worship, then he sprinkled everything with that blood, the book where the laws were written and the people.
\bttq For what purpose?
\tqe To start the Agreement, to put it into effect.
\tqref HEB 9.21-22
\bttq What else did Moses do?
\tqe He sprinkled that blood over the tent and the things used for worship there.
\bttq Why?
\tqe To make them acceptable to God, to remove (people's) sin from it, set them apart for him.
\bttq Why did he do it that way? (or, What else does it say about sin and blood?) (or, What does it say about how things were made "clean?")
\tqe Almost everything under the Old Agreement was made acceptable to God by sprinkling it with blood.
\bttq Why?
\tqe Because God cannot forgive sin unless there has been a sacrifice in which blood is shed.
\dh  Specifics
\tqref HEB 9.19
\bttq When Moses sprinkled that blood over the book and the people etc., what did he use to sprinkle it with?
\tqe A hyssop plant and red colored sheep wool cloth.

\bttq Briefly tell in your own words what the author said.
\tqe The tent/place of worship here on earth was only a copy of the place in heaven. The sacrifice to prepare that place had to be far greater than the sacrifice required to prepare the place here on earth. Jesus's sacrifice was that greater sacrifice. He died once and for all and with his blood has entered into the Presence of God in heaven on people's behalf.
\bttq Tell in your own words as much as you can remember.
\tqref HEB 9.23
\bttq What does it say here about the earthly place of worship?
\tqe It is only a copy of the real place of worship in heaven.
\bttq Tell me again what kind of sacrifices were required in the earthly place of worship and for what?
\tqe Animal sacrifices were required to make the earthly place of worship acceptable to God.
\bttq If animal sacrifices were required to prepare a place for people and God to meet here on earth, what kind of sacrifice was required for the heavenly place of worship?
\tqe It had to be a far better sacrifice.
\tqref HEB 9.24
\bttq Where did Christ go?
\tqe Christ went right into that place of worship in heaven, right into the presence of God.
\bttq Why did he go there?
\tqe He went there to act on people's behalf (like a high priest going into the Tent on behalf of the people).
\tqref HEB 9.25-26
\bttq What does this say about the Jewish high priest and Christ?
\tqe It says the Jewish high priest had to go into the presence of God with the blood of an animal every year, but Christ only went once.
\bttq Why does he not go every year? (or, If Christ had had to take a sacrifice in to God every year as the Jewish priest did, what would he have had to do to be able to do that?)
\tqe If he went every year, it would mean that he would have to suffer and die many times.
\bttq Beginning when?
\tqe From the creation of the world.
\bttq Is that what happened? (or, Is that how he did it?) (No.) What did happen then?
\tqe He died once and for all.
\bttq When?
\tqe In these last days. (or, Now when the Old Agreement is ended and the New Agreement is beginning.)
\bttq What else does it say about his dying?
\tqe He died to make the payment so that God could forgive people's sins and put them away forever.
\tqref HEB 9.27-28
\bttq What does this say about dying?
\tqe Everybody must die once.
\bttq And after that?
\tqe He will be judged by God.
\bttq So what does it say about Christ and his dying?
\tqe He also died once and was judged by God.
\bttq Judged by God? For what?
\tqe For the sins of many people (not his own).
\bttq What else does it say about Christ?
\tqe When he comes to the earth again, he will not have to die again.
\bttq So what will he do?
\tqe He will rescue all those who are waiting for him and take them to live with God forever.
\dh Specifics (Review)
\bttq Why was it that the High Priest had to take the blood with him when he went into the Presence of God?
\tqe To prove that an animal had died to pay for his sins and the sins of the people.
\bttq So why did Jesus have to take his own blood when he went into God's Presence in heaven?
\tqe To prove that he had died for the sins of people.
\bttq Why didn't he just take the blood of animals like the Jewish priests?
\tqe The blood of animals is not good enough to take away permanently the sins of people.

\tqe Key Term Check: In this context it was done as a symbolic act when praying to God to heal a sick person. The disciples of Jesus often anointed sick people with oil when they asked God to heal them. Probably they poured or smeared oil on the forehead of the person. In this context the action seems to have been symbolic, although rubbing or massaging a person with oil was also practiced as a medical treatment in the ancient world. (See "anoint" in KBT.)

\bttq What do you think happens, when someone forgives someone else?

\bttq What else should they do so that they might be healed [by God]?
\tqe They should confess their sins to one another and pray for one another. (16)
\bttq How can they be sure that praying will help their situation?
\tqe The prayer of a righteous person is very powerful in its effect. (16)
\bttq What do you think it means for someone to be righteous?

\bttq About whom was John talking in these verses?
\tqe He was talking about Jesus/Christ who revealed who God is. // He is called The Word. He was the one who was the expression of who God is. (1)
\an (Note: Check to see if "Word" or "Message" can be understood as a person. Does the grammar/sentence structure at least allow for a symbolic interpretation i.e., that the Word refers to Jesus Christ and not just a literal spoken or written word?

\bttq Who do you think God is?

\an In many languages the term for God is a proper name and cannot be used to refer to anyone except the one supreme creator of the world. It cannot be pluralised. (Or, if it can be pluralised, the meaning may be something very different from the English "gods". In one language, the plural form of God, meant "God and those who follow him" and was an appropriate way to translate "saints".) (See "God" in KBT.)

In Moslem cultures, or other cultures where lambs are sacrificed, they may be able to pick up the implication that Jesus is the one who will be the sacrifice through which God will forgive sins. In such cultures, check that the appropriate word has been used for "lamb" to suggest this idea.) (29) (See "lamb of God" in KBT in the "sacrifice" entry.)
\bttq What do you think it means when someone sacrifices a lamb in this way?
\tqe Key Term Check: "Sacrifice" is the religious act of making a gift to God, or to some other powerful spiritual being, in order to establish, maintain, or restore a proper relationship between the sacrificer and the deity.

If the one who offended repents and accepts this forgiveness, the result is that the relationship between the two, which was broken by the offense, is restored and the guilt of the offender is removed. (See "forgive" in KBT.)
\bttq What does a person do when he sins?
\tqe Key Term Check: He deliberately keeps on doing those things that please himself and displease God. (See "sin" in KBT.)

\bttq Where do you think Heaven is?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is that part of God's creation above the earth and the waters, including "air" and "space," and serves as home for God and the spirits who serve Him. (See "heaven" in KBT.)

\bttq Where were Jesus's disciples?

\bttq What is the reason that the woman was surprised that Jesus asked her for a drink of water?
\tqe She was surprised because Jesus was a Jew, and the woman was a Samaritan. (9)
\an (Note: The Jews never used the same dishes that Samaritans used. An alternative interpretation (less likely) is this: The Jews did not usually have anything to do with the Samaritans.)
\an (Note: According to the T.H., there was a Jewish religious regulation in force around A.D. 65 which stated that Samaritan women were in a state of perpetual ritual impurity from the time of their birth; and anyone, who had contact with them, would share that ritual impurity. For that reason the Jews did not use dishes in common with the Samaritans.)

\an (Note: "I do not know" would be an acceptable answer here. The main point of this question would be to check that there are no wrong implications. The most likely explanation is that he was referring to the Holy Spirit, often symbolized by water in John's gospel. Another possibility is that he was referring to the Jewish Law, from which Jesus quoted, and which in Rabbinical literature, was sometimes referred to as "God's gift".)

\bttq Whose father [ancestor] was Jacob?
\tqe He was an ancestor of the Jews and the Samaritans. (12)
\an (Note: According to the T.H., "our" ancestor could be interpreted as inclusive or exclusive. If it is inclusive, then she and Jesus had a common ancestor in Jacob. If it is exclusive, then Jacob was an ancestor of the Samaritans and not of the Jews.)
\bttq According to that woman, to whom had Jacob given the well?
\tqe According to her, Jacob gave it to the [Samaritans]. (12)

\tqe He said: "True worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth." (23)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant by "in spirit and truth"?
\an (Note: "I do not know" would be an acceptable answer. There are various interpretations of this verse. According to Exegetical Helps, "spirit" could mean man's spirit or the Spirit of God. The T.H. states, that wherever the word "spirit" occurs unmarked in John's Gospel, the reference is to God's spirit. According to the NIV Commentary it is not likely that "spirit" here means the Holy Spirit. The human spirit is in mind here. One must worship, not simply outwardly but, in ones spirit. For "truth" the T.H. states that, in this Gospel, "truth" refers primarily to God himself.)

In this case the "do you not say" would refer to a proverbial saying that was generally said, and "you" refers to people in general; Or (b) that from the time when Jesus was speaking, it was still four months until the harvest would be ready. In this case, the "you" would refer to the disciples. Commentators tell us that it was actually six months from planting time to harvest, so interpretation (b) is probably more likely.)

\bttq What did Jude tell his friends to remember?
\tqe He told them to remember the words of the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. (17)
\bttq What do you think an apostle does?
\tqe Key Term Check: The general meaning of the Greek word apostolos is "envoy", "appointed representative", "someone who is sent on a mission". In the New Testament it develops the specific sense of an appointed representative of Jesus Christ. In Acts and the rest of the New Testament, the term "apostle" is the most common term that is used to refer to those who were commissioned by Jesus Christ to be founders of the church, and who then took up that function and position.

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 1.1-4
\bttq What do you think was Luke's purpose in writing this first passage?
\tqe Luke wanted to tell Theophilus the reason why he wrote all the rest of this book.
\dh Details
\bttq To whom did Luke write these words?
\tqe He wrote to an important man named Theophilus. (3)
\an (Note: If it is possible in your language, show that Theophilus was more important than Luke. Luke spoke with respect to Theophilus.)
\bttq Many people had been writing about the same things. What were those things?
\tqe They had been writing about the events that had taken place among them. (1)
\an (Note: Luke used the words "among us". If your language uses one pronoun to include the listener within the group and another pronoun to exclude the listener, the pronoun used here should exclude Theophilus. The events happened among people whom Luke knew. They were groups of Jews and others who believed in Jesus. We do not know whether Theophilus was either a Jew or a believer when Luke wrote to him.)
\bttq What do you think those events were telling about?
\tqe They told about Jesus.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They told about the things Jesus had said and done.
\bttq How did those people know the things about which they had written?
\tqe They had seen those things happen (from when they first began). (2)
\bttq How did Luke know about those events?
\tqe He carefully checked into all those matters which were related to Jesus's life and work, beginning with the first things that happened. (3)
\bttq What was Luke's purpose for writing about these same things?
\tqe He wrote so that Theophilus would know that the information he had been told was true and reliable. (4)

\rf Luke 1:5-25 An angel told Zechariah that his wife would bear his son, John the Baptizer.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 1.5-25
\bttq Tell me about the things that happened to Zechariah.
\tqe An angel appeared to Zechariah while he was working in the temple as a priest. The angel told him that his wife, Elizabeth, would have a baby son and that he must name him John. Because Zechariah and Elizabeth were very old and she had never been able to have a baby before, Zechariah did not believe the angel. Because he did not believe, the angel made him unable to speak until the baby was born. After Zechariah returned home, Elizabeth became pregnant.
\bttq What was so important about Elizabeth conceiving and bearing a son that Luke wrote about it to Theophilus?
\tqe An old, barren couple conceiving and bearing a child (7) would show that God was doing this. People would know that God had important work for John to do when he grew up (15-17).
\tqe John would prepare people for Jesus's coming (17).
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 1.5-7
\bttq At what time did Zechariah and Elizabeth live?
\tqe They lived during the time when Herod was king of Judea. (5)
\bttq What work did Zechariah's do?
\tqe He was a priest. (5)
\bttq What do you think a priest did when he worked?
\tqe Key Term Check: He represented the people who came to worship God. He acted in their place by offering their sacrifices, prayers and gifts to God. He also represented God to those people when he announced that God had accepted their offerings and had forgiven their sins. (See "priest" in KBT.)
\bttq How did Zechariah and Elizabeth act and live?
\tqe They lived in a way which God had said was right, obeying all his commands/commandments. No one could say they had broken God's laws. (6)
\an (Note: Because Luke explained here what "righteous" living is, a question about this Key Term will not be asked until it is used again at verse 17.)
\bttq What commands/commandments do you think that the Lord expects people to follow/obey?
\tqe Key Term Check: The answer should focus on actions like those named in the Ten Commandments (Exod. 20:1-17; Deut. 5:1-21), but may include other instructions God gave to his people as well.
\bttq To whom did Luke refer in the words "the Lord's commandments" (6), "the Lord's temple" (9) and "the Lord's angel" (11)?
\tqe He referred to God himself.
\tqe Key Term Check: The word "lord" refers to a person who has authority over another person. God has supernatural authority over all of mankind because he created everyone and everything in the world. See "Lord" in KBT in the "God" entry.
\bttq Why did Elizabeth have no children?
\tqe She was not able to bear any children
\tqe and now both she and her husband were old. (7)

\bttq How do the people who speak your language choose someone when everyone, or no one, wants to be chosen?
\an (Note: Listen for whether the words used in the translation are used, or not used, to describe the culture's customs.)
\bttq If the people who speak your language do something like the priests did in order to help them decide things, tell me what they do.
\an (Note: The words used in the translation should not refer to actions that are illegal or that are opposed by the Christian churches present in the language area.)
\bttq What kind of a building do you think a temple is?
\tqe Key Term Check: A temple is a place where people gather to worship/sing/pray/offer sacrifices to a spirit being. This one was for worshipping God. (See "temple" in KBT.) (9)
\bttq What were the people who were worshipping doing at the time Zechariah went inside the temple to burn incense for God?
\tqe They were praying. (10)
\bttq Where were they praying?
\tqe They were outside (the temple building, but not outside the temple grounds). (10)
\an (Note: This referred to the main building, which Zechariah had entered. The worshippers had not left the temple grounds.)
\an (Note: A footnote may be necessary to clarify that the temple was regarded as so holy that only the priests were permitted to enter into it [Lev. 9 and 16]. All the worshippers stayed outside the front of the building.)
\bttq What do you think that people do when they pray?
\tqe They ask someone, usually a spirit being, for help with their problems and needs or the problems and needs of other people. They thank and praise the spirit for his past help and blessings. 
\an (Note: In the GNT, this talking is only with God.)
\tqref LUK 1.11-17
\an (Note: Because the last verses of this section are more difficult to remember and understand, you may want to read and ask the questions about the first verses before going on to the last ones. If the translation has paragraph breaks, follow that division. If there are no paragraph breaks in these verses, then divide the reading and questions as they are divided below.)
\tqref LUK 1.11-13
\bttq What happened while Zechariah was inside the temple?
\tqe An angel (of the Lord) appeared to him. (11)
\bttq Who do you think an angel is and what does he do?
\tqe Key Term Check: An angel is a good spirit being whom God created. He stays where God is and does whatever work God tells him to do. Often he carries a message from God to someone. (See "angel" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think an altar is?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is a table-like structure usually made of wood or piled stones. Gifts of incense, food, animals or other valuable things are set on its flat top to give to God or to other spirits. Often those gifts are burned up on the top of the altar. The altar of incense in the temple was made of wood and then covered with gold (Exod. 30:1-10; 37:25-29; 1 Chron. 28:18). (See "altar" in KBT.)
\bttq Pretend you are the angel and this table/chair/bench/tree is the altar. Show me where the angel was standing according to this verse.
\tqe (Because many languages describe "right" and "left" by referring to a person's or animal's "hands", an object like an altar cannot have a "right side" or a "left side", even though the Greek and English languages allow it. The object that the person is using to represent the altar should be at that person's left side as he/she faces you, the checker.
\tqe If the person is not standing in the correct place, you should go and stand in the correct position. Then ask the person to tell you the correct way to describe where you are now standing. That may be by saying that the altar was at the angel's left-hand side.)
\an (Note: A few writers say that the "right side" referred to Zechariah's right side, but the grammar here parallels other examples that are not disputed, such as Mark 10:37 and John 21:6.)
\bttq How did Zechariah feel when he saw the angel?
\tqe He was alarmed and afraid. (12)
\bttq What did the angel say to Zechariah about that?
\tqe Zechariah should not be afraid because God had heard [and was ready to answer] his prayer (about having a son). (13)
\bttq What else did the angel say about God answering Zechariah's prayer?
\tqe Zechariah's wife, Elizabeth, would give birth to his son and he must name the boy John. (13)
\tqe Key Term Check: Choosing the right name for a person or a place was extremely important to the Jews. See "name" in KBT.
\tqref LUK 1.14-17
\bttq Whom did the angel say would be happy that John was born?
\tqe He said that Zechariah himself and many other people, too, would rejoice. (14)
\bttq For what reason would they be so happy?
\tqe John would be important and honored in God's sight, that is, according to what God considers important. (14-15)
\an (Note: The person who answers may include things in his/her answer from the items in the answer below the next question. You may then skip over the next question.)
\bttq How would John's life show that he was an important worker for God?
\tqe He would never drink wine or any other drink that could make him drunk. (15)
\an (Note: A footnote may be needed to indicate that God required this of priests while they were on duty [Lev. 10:8-9]. He also required those who took the Nazirite vow to live like this [Num. 6:1-4].)
\an  
\tqe He would be filled with the Holy Spirit right from his birth or even before that. // He would have the Holy Spirit in his life right from his birth or even before that. (15)
\tqe Key Term Check: The Holy Spirit is the spirit of the holy God. He works in people's hearts/spirits/lives on God's behalf, revealing God's will to us and guiding us to please God. See "Holy Spirit" in KBT in the "advocate, counselor" entry and also in the "spirit" entry.
\an  
\tqe He would cause many Israelites/Jews to turn [their hearts/lives away from sin] to obeying God. (16)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "Israel" and "Jew" in KBT in the "Israel, Jew, Hebrew" entry.
\an  
\tqe He would work with the same kind of power and spirit as [the prophet] Elijah had done. (17)
\an (Note: This may be translated:
\an "having the same determination and attitude as Elijah had",
\an -OR-
\an "having God's power and spirit the same as Elijah had.")
\an  
\an (Note: Luke did not use the word "prophet" here, but you should ask the next question about the assistant's understanding of who Elijah was and what he had done.)
\bttq Who do you think Elijah was?
\tqe He was a prophet in Old Testament times (1Kng. 17-2Kng. 2).
\tqe He did many miracles and spoke God's messages to many people, including many kings.
\tqe He never died, but God took him up to heaven alive (2Kng. 2).
\an (Note: You may want to make a footnote or reference that in the last two verses of the Old Testament God said that he would send Elijah back to earth just before the savior would come. More than four hundred years later the angel Gabriel used those very same words when he told Zechariah what his son John would do. Jesus later said that John had done the same work in the same way as Elijah had done earlier [Matt. 11:14; Mark 9:11-13].)
\bttq What do you think a prophet does?
\tqe Key Term Check: A prophet tells people messages that come from the spirit world. In the Bible only the men who spoke messages from God were called prophets. They spoke for God about what he had done in the past or would do in the future. They told how that would affect the people who were listening to them. (See "prophet" in KBT.)
\bttq What was this important work that John would do when he grew up?
\tqe He would help many Israelites/Jews to turn their hearts to God (16) by turning their hearts to [love] their fellowmen/children, and by turning away from disobeying God to following the way of people who acted rightly. (17),
\an -OR-
\an He would go ahead of the Lord (their God) and get many people ready for him to come into their lives [physically and spiritually/to rule and reign]. (17)
\an (Note: The words "the Lord" as found here in some English translations is the word "him" in the Greek text. "Him" clearly refers back five words earlier to "the Lord their God" (vs. 16). The Jews referred to only one spirit being as "the Lord" [see Deut. 6, especially vs. 4]. Any words used in a translation that only allow for Jesus, the Messiah, to be understood in this verse need adjusting.)
\bttq What do you think a righteous person is like?
\tqe Key Term Check: A righteous person is one who wants to please God by living the way God says is the right way. (See verse 6 again. Also see "righteous" in KBT in the "just, justify" entry.)
\tqref LUK 1.18-20
\bttq What did Zechariah say when he heard that his wife would bear a son for him?
\tqe "I myself and my wife are too old. How will I know this will really happen?" (18)
\bttq Do you think that Zechariah's response showed that he believed the angel or that he did not believe him?
\tqe His words showed that he did not believe the angel/did not have strong faith.
\an (Note: The key terms of "believe" and "faith" are discussed in verse 20, below.)
\bttq How did the words of Zechariah show that he did not believe the angel?
\tqe He asked the angel to do something to prove that he had the power to do what he had said. (18)
\bttq What authority did the angel have to tell this message to Zechariah?
\tqe He, Gabriel, stood in the very presence of God, (that is, he was a special angel to whom God gave the important work to do). God had sent him to Zechariah to tell him this good news. (19)
\bttq What was the angel's good news?
\tqe God had heard Zechariah's prayers to have a child. He was going to give Zechariah a son (13).
\an (Note: The Greek word Luke used here means "tell good news". It is the same word he used regularly elsewhere in this book to indicate that God's plan to send the Messiah to save people was happening right then. That meaning is also in the words of the angel here (17), but it is not what a person would think of immediately. Zechariah's son would be preparing people for the Lord God's coming into the world in the person of his son, Jesus, to save them. That was "good news". If the language assistant includes this point in his/her answer, give him/her special praise.)
\bttq What sign did the angel give to Zechariah to prove that he was telling him the truth?
\tqe Zechariah would not be able to speak until the day those things happened, that is, the day that child was born. (20)
\bttq Why did Zechariah have this problem/difficulty?
\tqe He did not believe what the angel had said. (20)
\bttq What does it mean that a person believes (or does not believe) what another person has said?
\tqe Key Term Check: That person is convinced/sure in his mind, he completely trusts, that the speaker told the truth. (See "believe" in KBT. "Faith" is also discussed in that entry.)
\tqref LUK 1.21-22
\bttq What were the people who were standing outside the temple thinking?
\tqe They were amazed that Zechariah was staying such a long time in the temple. (21) (They did not know any normal reason why this should be happening, so it seemed very strange.)
\bttq What happened when Zechariah did come back out to them?
\tqe Zechariah was not able to speak to them, so he used his hands to make signs. (22)
\bttq What did the people think that Zechariah's actions meant?
\tqe The people then knew that he had seen a vision inside the temple. (22)
\bttq What do you think happens when a person sees a vision?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is like a person having a dream when he is wide awake and his eyes are wide open. The person often can see spirit beings and see or hear things he did not know about before. God helped Zechariah to see and hear the angel.
\tqref LUK 1.23-25
\bttq When did Zechariah return home?
\tqe He returned home when his time of serving in the temple was finished. (23)
\bttq What happened after he was back home?
\tqe His wife Elizabeth became pregnant. (24)
\bttq What did Elizabeth do then?
\tqe She just stayed in and around her house. She did not want a lot of people to see her. (24)
\bttq How long did she do like that?
\tqe She did that for five months. (24)
\bttq What did she say/think about being pregnant?
\tqe She said that this was the way the Lord had helped her. He was now taking away the disgrace/humiliation/shame she felt/had in the eyes of other people. (25)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that people humiliated Elizabeth or caused her to feel shame?
\tqe She had never borne a child, especially no son.

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 1.26-38
\bttq Tell me about the things that happened to Mary.
\tqe God sent an angel to tell Mary that she would have a baby son and that his name would be Jesus. Mary was surprised and frightened by this. She asked the angel how this could happen because she was not married yet. The angel said that God himself would cause her to become pregnant. Therefore, the child would be the son of God. Mary accepted that this was what God wanted for her, so she was willing for this to happen to her.
\bttq What was so important about Mary conceiving and bearing a son that Luke wrote about it to Theophilus?
\tqe A virgin conceiving and bearing a child would show that God was doing this. (27, 31, 34, 35)
\tqe This child, Jesus, would be referred to as (or called) the Son of God. (32, 35)

\tqe She lived in the town of Nazareth in the district/province/state of Galilee. (26)
\tqe She was a virgin. (27)
\tqe She was promised in marriage to Joseph. (27)
\bttq What did Luke tell us about Joseph?
\tqe He was a descendant of [Israel's great king,] David. (27)
\bttq What did the angel say to Mary?
\tqe "Hello/Good Day, you to whom the Lord has shown great kindness. He is with you." (28)
\tqref LUK 1.29-33
\bttq What did Mary think after hearing him say that?
\tqe She was thoroughly confused/mixed up/in turmoil. (29)
\tqe She wondered what these unusual words of greeting really meant.
\bttq What did the angel say was the reason that Mary was not to be afraid?
\tqe God had decided to show special kindness to her. (30)
\bttq What was going to happen which would show God's kindness to Mary?
\tqe She would become pregnant and bear a [special] son. (31)
\bttq What did the angel say to show Mary that her son would be a special/important person?
\tqe The angel told her the name God had chosen for the child, the name Jesus. (31)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The angel told her what name she must give to the child. (31)

\bttq What did the angel say about how Mary would become pregnant?
\tqe The Holy Spirit would do it supernaturally./The Holy Spirit would make it happen. (35)
\bttq What did the angel say would show that it was true that God made it happen?
\tqe The child would be holy and would be called the son of God. (35)
\bttq What do you think makes someone holy?
\tqe Key Term Check: God declares that person to be set apart from the way people live to please themselves. He sets them apart in order to totally serve him. That person would be morally pure, acting in all ways like God would act. (If you discuss how God is holy, see the question at verses 49b-50 below.)
\bttq Why did the angel tell Mary that Elizabeth was pregnant?
\tqe Elizabeth, who had been unable to have children and now was very old, was already into her sixth month of pregnancy. Since that seemed impossible, but was true, then nothing would be too difficult for God to do. [Mary, too, would have the baby the angel was telling her about.] // Whatever God says will happen, he will use his great power to make happen. He had already helped old Elizabeth become pregnant. [Therefore, Mary should believe what the angel was telling her also.] (36-37)
\tqref LUK 1.38
\bttq When the angel talked earlier with Zechariah, Zechariah did not believe that what the angel said would really be able to happen. How did Mary respond to the angel's message to her?
\tqe She did believe him.
\bttq What did Mary say that showed that she believed him?
\tqe She said that she was ready to serve God, to allow him to use her in the way the angel had said. // Because she thought of herself as God's servant/slave, she would be happy for him to use her in the way the angel had said.
\bttq What do you think a slave is?
\tqe Key Term Check: A slave is a person who must do whatever his/her master wants because the master owns the person as a possession. The slave is not free to do what he likes or go where he likes. (See "servant, slave" in KBT.)

\tqe She got ready and went quickly to the town where Elizabeth lived. (39)
\bttq How long a time does it sound like Mary traveled to go to Elizabeth? 
\an (Note: Because the distance Mary traveled would have been more than 70 miles (115 km.), the translation of "went quickly" should allow for 3-4 days of travel.)
\bttq Where was the town where Zechariah and Elizabeth lived?
\tqe It was in the hilly/mountainous region of Judah (Judea). (39)
\an (Note: Luke wrote the name as "Judah", the Jews' traditional name for the area, the name used in the Old Testament. It referred to the descendants of Judah, whom God had told to live there. At the time Zechariah and Elizabeth lived there, the Roman government called the area the province of "Judea". That name is used elsewhere in the New Testament. Whichever name is in your translation, it should be clear to the readers as to what the name refers, whether to a tribal/clan territory or to a government name.)
\bttq What happened when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting?
\tqe The baby in Elizabeth's womb leaped/jerked/moved excitedly for joy. (41, 44)
\tqe The Holy Spirit filled/inspired Elizabeth to speak out with a loud voice/excitedly. (41)
\bttq What did Elizabeth say about God's kindness towards Mary?
\tqe God was blessing her more than he had blessed any other woman. (He was also blessing the child she would bear.) (42)
\bttq What does it mean to bless someone and to be blessed?
\tqe Key Term Check: One person praises/says good things about the other person or asks God to do good things for that person. (See "bless, blessed, blessing" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think this special blessing from God was which Elizabeth was talking about?
\tqe Mary would give birth to God's son. No other woman would have that privilege and honor.
\bttq What had the Holy Spirit revealed to Elizabeth about Mary's baby?
\tqe He would be Elizabeth's Lord. (43)
\an (Note: What Elizabeth said shows us that she already knew the baby in Mary's womb was the savior God had promised, even God himself.)
\bttq How did Elizabeth feel about such an important person coming into her home?
\tqe She felt unworthy/undeserving of such an honor. (43)
\bttq How did she know that Mary was pregnant and that Mary's baby would be her own Lord?
\tqe At the same time that she heard Mary greet her, the baby in her own womb leaped/jerked/moved excitedly for joy. That confirmed to her that what she had learned from the Holy Spirit was true. (41, 44)
\bttq What did Elizabeth feel was the reason that Mary was so blessed/fortunate/in such a happy state?
\tqe Mary believed that what the Lord had said to her [through the angel] really would happen. (45)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 1.46-56
\bttq Why did Mary want to talk about these things?

\bttq What did Mary say that God had done?
\tqe He thought about/remembered his people, her in particular (48), but also all of the Israelites (54).
\tqe He saved them from bad kings [and other dangers]. (47, 52)
\tqe He helped her (48) and all of the Israelite people (53-54).
\tqe He was merciful to them (50, 54) as he had promised (her forefathers, such as Abraham and his descendants,) long ago (55).
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 1.46-48
\bttq What did Mary say it was that made her very joyful?
\tqe God [cared about her and] had taken notice of her, even though she thought of herself as only a servant/slave of God/only a very ordinary, unimportant person. (48)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "servant/slave" above at 1:38. Also see "servant, slave" in KBT.
\tqe Key Term Check: See "soul" and "spirit" in KBT. The Jews used sets of synonyms to create parallel lines in their Hebrew poetry. Thus, a person can understand "soul" and "spirit"  in verses 46 and 47 as synonyms for Mary herself. However, elsewhere in the Bible "soul" refers to a person's inner self, that part we call "life" itself. It refers more to the humanness of a person, that is, his physical aspects rather than his spiritual aspects. "Spirit", on the other hand, refers to a person's relationship with the supernatural world, especially God. Both the physical and the spiritual aspects of Mary, that is, her whole self, was very joyful.
\tqref LUK 1.48-49
\bttq What would show that God had truly taken special notice of her?
\tqe From that time onward all generations would refer to Mary as having a special blessing from God. (48)
\bttq Why would everyone think and speak like that about her?
\tqe The mighty God had done great/important things for her [in making her the mother of the Savior]. (49)
\tqref LUK 1.49-50
\bttq Because God had chosen Mary to be the mother of the Savior, what did she understand better about God? 
\tqe He is always holy and very merciful to all those people who are in awe of him/those who revere and respect him as God.
\bttq What do you think it means that God is holy?
\tqe Key Term Check: He is perfectly good and right in everything he is and does. There is nothing bad, wrong or evil in him or in what he does. No one else is like him. We honor and worship him because he is like that.
\bttq What do you think it means that God is very merciful?
\tqe Key Term Check: He has deep feelings of genuine compassion/loving concern for people and, because of that, he does not punish their sin/wrongdoing as they deserve. (See "mercy" in KBT.)
\tqref LUK 1.51-53
\bttq What are some of the ways in which God has used his power/strength to help his people?
\tqe He has scattered those people who think proud thoughts about themselves. (51)
\tqe He has brought the reign and high status of [some] kings to an end (52a), 
\tqe but given increased status to the humble people/and made humble people important (52b).
\tqe He has generously given those people with [spiritual] needs everything they needed, even more,
\tqe but has taken away the good things [of this world] from those who trusted in them [instead of trusting God]. (51-53)

\bttq What were the neighbors' and relatives' responses to these things?
\tqe The people rejoiced with Elizabeth. (58)
\tqe They were amazed that Zechariah also wanted to name the baby John. (63)
\tqe People all over that (hilly/mountainous) area talked much about all these things (65)
\tqe and thought seriously about what this boy would be [or what he would do] in the future. (66)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 1.57-58
\bttq What happened to show that the Lord had been very merciful/kind towards Elizabeth?

\tqref LUK 1.59-64
\bttq What happened on the child's eighth day?
\tqe People came to circumcise and name the baby. (59)
\bttq What do you think that the people did to this new baby boy when they circumcised him?
\tqe Key Term Check: They cut off the ring of foreskin from around the boy's penis. (See peritemnw in L&N in entry 53.51.)
\an (Note: If the translator is using the name of a cultural ceremony, ask about all its implications physically, culturally and spiritually. The Jews did the ceremony as a religious rite which dedicated the child to God and physically marked him as a Jew. If the translator's culture does not practice circumcision, describing the action may sound offensive and vulgar to any mixed group of men and women or children. The translator may need to use a more general word or phrase in the translation and refer to a footnote or glossary item. In that note the translator can explain clearly what is done to a male's body and tell why it was customary to do it on a Jewish baby's eighth day [Gen. 17:9-14; Lev. 12:1-3].)
\bttq What problem came up among the people at Zechariah's house that day?
\tqe The friends and relatives wanted to call/name the boy (his father's name,) Zechariah. (59, 61)
\tqe But Elizabeth strongly told them, "No", and said that he would be named/called John. (60)
\bttq How did the visitors and Zechariah communicate with each other?
\tqe They used [hand] signs/sign language. (62-63)
\bttq How did Zechariah show what he thought about the boy's name?
\tqe He asked for something on which to write and he wrote the name John. (63)
\bttq Why were all the people amazed at Zechariah's answer?
\tqe They did not know any reason for his answer because neither the boy's father nor any other relative was being honored by giving him that name. (61)
\tqe Also, both the father and mother agreed that the child's name was to be John. (60, 63)
\bttq Why did Zechariah and Elizabeth name the boy John?
\tqe They named him John because that was the name the angel had told Zechariah to name him even before Elizabeth was pregnant. (1:13)
\bttq What happened to Zechariah at the moment he wrote the name?
\tqe He was able to speak again. (64)
\bttq What did Zechariah first talk about after he could speak?
\tqe He blessed/praised God. (64)
\tqref LUK 1.65-66
\bttq What did people do after they had seen or heard about the events surrounding John's birth?
\tqe They were all fearful/in reverential awe and talked very much about these events. (65)
\tqe They thought much/seriously about what it all meant (66a)
\tqe and they said, "What will this child be [when he grows up]?" (66b)
\bttq What did those people recognize was happening in these unusual events?
\tqe They recognized that God was actively overseeing all that happened to John. (66c)

\rf Luke 1:67-80 Zechariah praised God and prophesied.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 1.67-80
\bttq What was Zechariah's purpose in talking about these things?
\tqe He wanted to praise God because God was about to send the savior to help his people (68) as he had promised long ago. (69-70, 72, 78-79)
\tqe He also wanted to speak the message that God's Spirit had given him about how John would fit into God's plans to send a savior to them. (76-77)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 1.67-75
\bttq How did Zechariah know about all these things?
\tqe The Holy Spirit was in him, guiding his thinking as he spoke. (67)
\bttq What do you think that Zechariah did when he prophesied?
\tqe Key Term Check: He spoke the message that God's spirit guided him to say about the past and the future. He reminded the people that, with the birth of John, God was beginning to do what he had said in the past that he would do.
\bttq What kind of help had God given to his people Israel?
\tqe God had come to set his people free (68) from their enemies (71). // God had come to release his people (68) from the control of their enemies (71).
\tqe Key Term Check: See "redeem, redemption, ransom" in KBT.
\an (Note: The translation of "enemies" should allow for spiritual enemies as well as human enemies.)
\bttq How was God going to set his people free?
\an He was sending a powerful savior (69), just as he had promised through his prophets long ago (70).
\tqe Key Term Check: For understanding the time frame which Zechariah used, see "age" in KBT in the "world, age" entry.
\bttq What does a savior do?
\tqe Key Term Check: He rescues/saves another person who is in danger of being hurt or even dying, if someone does not help him quickly. (See "save, salvation, savior" in KBT.)
\bttq From which well-known family would this savior come?
\tqe He would be a descendant of [former king] David who had served God. (69)
\bttq What kind of a relationship do you think that David had with God? (69)
\tqe David wanted to help/please God, so he did what God asked him to do. God was pleased with David.
\an (Note: Although English translations use the word "servant", the Greek word is not the same one normally translated "servant" or "slave". The word used here is normally translated "child", and in the context here the focus is on the kind of loving help a child gives his father.)
\bttq Zechariah said that God was sending a savior. What did that show to Zechariah? 
\tqe It showed him that God was being merciful to Abraham and the other [Israelite] forefathers. He (God) was doing what he had promised/said he would do in the covenant he had made with them. (72-73)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe God was being merciful to the [Israelites'] ancestors by continuing to keep his part of the covenant promise that he had made to Abraham and the other forefathers. (72-73)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe God was being merciful just as he had firmly promised to Abraham and the other forefathers. (72-73)
\bttq What is a covenant?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is an agreement, an especially binding promise, usually made by two people who are of equal status. If the person on one side of the covenant does not do as both have agreed, there usually is a strong punishment for him or he pays compensation to the other person. Today it would be called a contract. But the Greek word that is used in the Bible for covenants strongly implies that the terms of the agreement were stated by the person on only one side of the discussion, not both sides. Usually God is the one who says what will happen, that is, what he will do and what people must do. He binds himself to the other party. (See "covenant" in KBT.)
\tqe (Note: If the language has a special name to refer to these kinds of agreements, ask the assistant(s) to tell you the kinds of situations in which the people make these special agreements, these firm promises. Listen for any points where it would not be appropriate to state that God made that kind of an agreement. If there are some questionable areas, the translator may need to re-think how he used that term in the translation.)
\bttq What do you think made this covenant a holy one? (72)
\tqe Key Term Check: It was holy because God, who made it, is holy. It came from God, he spoke it, so it had the same characteristics that God has.
\bttq What does a person do when he swears an oath? (73)
\tqe Key Term Check: He uses strong, positive words to show that he will truly do as he has just promised. He also calls on God (Mark 14:71) or another spirit being (Josh. 23:10; Jer. 13:16; Amos 8:14) to punish him very badly if anything he has just said is not completely true. (See 2 Sam. 3:35.)
\bttq What do you think will assure a person that God will do what he promises?
\tqe God is holy [Amos 4:2] and has all the power necessary to do anything he says. When he makes a promise, the other person will know for sure that God will do it.
\an (Note: Sometimes God says he swears by himself. [See Gen. 22:16, where you will find the covenant and oath Zechariah was talking about here.] He also swears by his name, that is, his reputation [Isa. 45:23]. Since God has never failed to keep his promises in the past and has never done any other bad action, he surely will not lie now, either [Ps. 89:34-35].)
\bttq What had God promised to Israel's ancestors?
\tqe He had promised to rescue them/save their people from being under the control of people who hated them/who were their enemies. (71, 74)
\tqe He would make them able to serve him without fearing (him).
\tqe -OR-
\tqe  … without fearing (that their enemies would persecute or attack them). (74)
\bttq How will they serve God without being afraid? (75)
\tqe They will serve him by doing what is right in the sight of God and man the rest of their lives.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They will serve him by being pure in their hearts and in their actions the rest of their lives.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They will serve him by not doing what is wrong, but by doing what is right the rest of their lives.
\an (Note: The three choices for verse 75 are the main interpretations of how the words "holiness" and "righteousness" relate to each other when they are found in the same sentence.)
\tqref LUK 1.76-79
\bttq In what way will John be a part of God's plan to send a savior?
\tqe He will go ahead of the Lord/savior to prepare the way for people (to accept him). (76)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He will go ahead of the Lord/savior to tell people to prepare their lives for his coming. (76)
\bttq What will people say about him because he does that work?
\tqe They will say he is a prophet of the Most High God/the Supreme God. (76)
\an (Note: If you already discussed the term "prophet" above in 1:17, skip over the next question.)
\bttq What work do you think that a prophet does?
\tqe Key Term Check: A prophet tells people messages which come from the spirit world. In the Bible only the men who spoke messages from God were called prophets. They spoke for God about what he had done in the past or would do in the future. They told how that would affect 
\tqe the people who were listening to them. (See "prophet" in KBT.)
\bttq How will John prepare the people to be ready for the savior?
\tqe He will tell them that God will save them when they ask him to forgive/remove their sins. (77)
\bttq What is sin?
\tqe Key Term Check: Because God made all people and told us how to live to please him, every time a person's thoughts, words or actions do not follow what God has said is right, that is sin. It is a turning away from being like God wants us to be. (See "sin, sinner" in KBT.)
\bttq What does God do when he forgives sins?
\tqe Key Term Check: He removes any record of a person's wrong action. That means that there is no need for the person to compensate God in any way, such as by being punished or by giving him good things or doing extra actions which would please him. God does not think of that person as being a bad person any longer, but as a person who is ready to do good. (See "forgive" in KBT.)
\bttq Why does God forgive people's sins?
\tqe It is because God has deep feelings of wanting to be merciful towards them. (78)
\bttq Tell me what the picture language about the sun/darkness/shadows means to you.
\tqe [THE SUN:] The sun is a picture of the savior coming from heaven to start a new day, a new period in our lives. He makes it clear to us how he saves us. Now we are encouraged about what is going to happen to us.
\tqe [DARKNESS/SHADOWS:] The time of not knowing about the true God and of being afraid that something, perhaps God or evil spirits, might soon make us die, ends. (78-79)
\an This question is only relevant if the translation of verses 78-79 has picture language about the sun or darkness or shadows.
\bttq Where is this place that Zechariah said the savior would come from?
\tqe Key Term Check: He said that the savior would come from heaven, that is, from the place where God and other spirit beings live. (78) (See "heaven, sky" in KBT.)
\an (Note: The word needed here may be different from the word for the physical sky, even though Greek and English use the same word for both meanings. Use what is correct for the culture and language of the translation.)
\bttq What do you think this peace is to which Zechariah referred?
\tqe Key Term Check: This peace is a calm heart/spirit which does not worry when we face God because he has already forgiven our sins. (See "peace" in KBT.)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Long, long ago God promised mankind that he would send someone to save them from the punishment they deserved. Later, God sent Jesus into this world as that savior. When we see clearly that God already has done what he promised to do, we have peace in our hearts. Peace is a calm heart/spirit and being free from worry. (See "peace" in KBT.)

\tqe He was the Caesar, the very highest government official in all the area which the Roman government ruled. (1) (He even ruled over the kings.)
\bttq Where were the people to go to record their names?
\tqe They were to go to the area/village where their ancestors had been born/had lived. (3)
\bttq Read the last verse of chapter 1 and the first verse of this chapter again. Will people think that Augustus commanded this when John was still a baby or after John had grown to be a man?
\tqe Augustus commanded this when John was still a baby.

\tqref LUK 2.4-7
\bttq What did Joseph do when he heard about the command to register/record his name?
\tqe He also obeyed the government's command to have their officials record his name in their book. (4, 5)
\tqe He left the town/village of Nazareth in [the province of] Galilee (4a)
\tqe and traveled to the town/village of Bethlehem in [the province of] Judea. (4b)
\tqe He traveled with Mary, the young woman who was promised in marriage to him. (5)
\bttq Why did Joseph go to the village of Bethlehem?
\tqe That was the village where Joseph's ancestor, (the famous king) David, had lived. (4b)
\bttq What do we learn about Mary from hearing/reading these verses?
\tqe She had been promised to Joseph to be his wife. (5)
\tqe She was pregnant. (5)
\tqe She went with Joseph to have the officials record their names in the government book. (4, 5)
\tqe She delivered a baby boy, her first child, while she and Joseph were at Bethlehem. (6-7)
\bttq How did Mary care for her baby son?
\tqe She wrapped him in pieces of cloth (according to the Jewish custom of that time) and laid him in a manger/an animal's food trough/box. (7)
\bttq Why did she have to use an animal's food box as the baby's bed?
\tqe Because all the places for travelers to stay (the inns/hotels) were already full of people, Joseph and Mary had to stay in the place where people usually fed their animals. (7)

\rf Luke 2:8-20 An angel told some shepherds about the baby and they went to see him.

\bttq God sent an angel at night with a message for some shepherds. What had happened that was so important for the shepherds to know?
\tqe The angel brought them the good news that the savior, Christ the Lord, had been born. (11) 
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 2.8-12
\bttq What were some shepherds doing the night when Mary bore her baby?
\tqe They were staying out in the open countryside guarding their flocks of sheep/goats at night. (8)
\bttq What caused the shepherds to be very much afraid?
\tqe They suddenly saw an angel standing in front of them (9a)
\tqe and the bright light of God's glory/presence was shining all around them. (9b)
\an (Key Term Check: The Greek word translated "glory" has many variations in meaning and use. Each meaning tries to describe a characteristic of God which people do not have. God is totally without sin. He is so different from sinful mankind that people find it hard to explain or describe what they see or experience when God makes his presence known. 
\an You probably will not find a word in your language which includes every aspect of the Greek word for glory and would be correct for every use. You will probably find that the use of "glory" in verse 14 below is already different from its usage here. As much as you are able, translate any one aspect of "glory" consistently. See "glory" in KBT.)
\bttq Why did the angel tell the shepherds they should not be afraid?
\tqe They were not to be afraid because he had come to tell them some good news which would cause all people to rejoice greatly. (10)
\bttq What was that good news?
\tqe The good news was that the savior had been born that same night. (11)
\tqe Key Term Check: Luke used the Greek word which means "tell good news." It is the same word he used in 1:19 and we will see it again at 3:18 and 4:18, among many other places. Luke always used it to refer to the good news that God's plan to send the Messiah to save people was already happening. That is also the meaning of the angel's words here [10-11.)
\bttq What did the angel say to indicate that this savior was someone very special?
\tqe He said that this savior was the Christ (the anointed one sent by God) and Lord (the one with authority to rule and reign over people [See Mic. 5:2]). (11)
\tqe Key Term Check: Make sure that the title "Christ" is understood to be just that, a title, not a personal name. You may wish to make a footnote or glossary entry which indicates that this is the Greek equivalent to the Hebrew title "Messiah". See "Christ, Messiah" in KBT.
\bttq Where did the angel say the savior was born?
\tqe In the village where [their ancestor, King] David had lived (that is, in Bethlehem). (11)
\bttq What would the shepherds see which would prove to them that what the angel said was true?
\bttq -OR-

\tqe They would find the baby wrapped in pieces of cloth (according to their Jewish custom) (12b)
\tqe and lying in a manger, that is, an animal's food trough/box. (12c)
\bttq What do you think is the reason this would be a sign to them?
\tqe People do not customarily put their babies into any animal's food box.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The Jews would not expect to find the savior, whom they expected God to send to earth, in such a humble place as a manger.

\bttq What suddenly happened near that angel?
\tqe A great number of other spirit beings from heaven (angels) appeared. (13)
\bttq What were those angels doing?
\tqe They were praising God. (13)
\an (Note: The Greek word used here is not one of the eight words used in the rest of the GNT text to refer to songs and singing. It does not tell us whether the angels sang or not. The focus of this verb is on the content and purpose of the action, not the manner.)
\bttq What did their words of praise say about God?
\tqe There is glory for God in highest [heaven]. (14)
\an (Note: "Highest" may refer to either the place where God is, or the place where the praising is occurring. Either way is acceptable, but if it can refer to both, that is even better.)
\bttq What do you think this glory is? (14)
\tqe Key Term Check: It is the best praise, honor, and giving of thanks which can be given to God because of his perfect goodness to them.
\bttq What did the angels say about people?
\tqe They said that there is peace among the people on the earth whom God has favored/with whom he is pleased. (14)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "peace" discussed above at 1:79.
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the angels said these things in their praising God?
\tqe They were happy that the Savior was born. He would bring that kind of glory to God and peace to mankind. (They recognized that, because the savior had been born, there now was this glory and peace in heaven and on the earth, and they were excited about it.)
\tqref LUK 2.15-20
\bttq When the angels finished praising God, what did they do?
\tqe They went back to heaven. (15)
\bttq What did the shepherds decide to do then?

\tqe -OR-
\tqe They decided to go to Bethlehem and see the savior whom [the angel of] the Lord had just told them had been born there that day. (15)
\bttq How do we know the men were very excited to go find this savior who had just been born?
\tqe They went hurriedly on their way. (16)
\bttq What did they find when they looked around the village of Bethlehem?

\bttq After they had seen the baby, what did they do?
\tqe They told people, [including Mary and Joseph,] what [the angel] had said to them about this child. (17)
\bttq When the people heard the shepherds' story of what had happened, what did they think?
\tqe All of them were amazed. (18) (This kind of thing did not normally happen, so it seemed very strange.)
\bttq How did Mary respond to all that had happened regarding her baby?
\tqe She kept thinking about them, wondering very much about what they meant. (19)
\bttq After the shepherds had told people about these things, what did they do?

\bttq What happened on the eighth day of Jesus's life?
\tqe He was circumcised,
\tqe and [his parents] named him Jesus.
\bttq Why did Mary and Joseph name their baby boy Jesus?
\tqe It was the name the angel had told Mary to name him even before she was pregnant (1:31).

\rf Luke 2:22-24 Mary and Joseph presented Jesus to God at the temple.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 2.22-24 
\bttq Why did Mary and Joseph take the baby Jesus to the temple at that particular time?
\tqe The Lord [God] had said that parents must present/dedicate every firstborn male child to him (Exod. 13:2, 12, 15). (22-23)
\tqe They also were to bring a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons [and give them to a priest] to offer as a sacrifice. (22, 24)
\an (Note: The Law of Moses and the Law of the Lord are discussed below.)
\dh Details
\bttq Why did Mary and Joseph wait some weeks before they went to the temple to present the baby Jesus to God?
\tqe They waited for the days/time to end for Mary to be ritually pure/clean again. (22)
\an (Note: The Law of Moses said that for 40 days after a Jewish woman had delivered a baby, she was not ritually clean/pure, so they waited for that time to end. The woman had to bring a special offering [Lev. 12:2-8] in order to become ritually clean/pure again. After she did that, she would again be allowed to go to the temple and participate in religious activities.)
\bttq What do you think that Luke was talking about when he referred to being made pure/clean?
\tqe Key Term Check: The words "made clean" here refer to being clean ritually, thus being allowed again into the public worship and the presence of God. If the translator used a very general word like "clean," check to make sure it does not mean only to remove external things, such as dried blood or dirt from the skin. If the translator is using a cultural term for a ceremony which must be performed by local women when they wish to return to normal activities after childbirth, ask about all its implications physically, culturally and spiritually. See "clean, pure" and "unclean, defiled, impure" in KBT.
\bttq What is the Law of Moses?
\tqe Key Term Check: The Law of Moses is the laws and instructions which God had revealed to Moses. Although Moses wrote them down, they were God's laws for his people/the Jews/the Israelites to follow. That is why Luke referred to the same laws both as "the Law of Moses" (22) and as "the Law of the Lord" (23, 24).  (See "law" in KBT.)
\an (Note: The Jews collected what Moses wrote, and those writings now are the first five books of the Old Testament.)
\bttq What kind of sacrifice did Mary bring?
\tqe She brought two doves or two young pigeons. (24)
\bttq What happened to those two birds when they were sacrificed?
\tqe Key Term Check: The priest killed them in a way that God had told them to use for such animals. Then they were given to God by burning them up (see Lev. 3, 6:24-30, and 12:6-8). (See "sacrifice" in KBT.)

\rf Luke 2:25-35 Simeon saw the baby Jesus and prophesied.

\bttq Tell me about Simeon going to the temple.
\tqe (The answer should include the basic facts and activities of the event. Those items not mentioned can be checked on in the detail questions below.)
\bttq What do you think that we are to learn from what Luke wrote about Simeon being at the temple?
\tqe Simeon was one of the Israelites who was waiting for the savior (Messiah) whom God had promised to send to them. The Holy Spirit showed Simeon that the baby, Jesus, was that savior (25, 26, 30).
\tqe -OR-
\tqe We can learn that Jesus is the savior of all the other ethnic groups of the world, as well (31-32).
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 2.25-28
\bttq Tell me some of the things you heard/read about Simeon in this section.
\tqe He lived in Jerusalem.
\tqe He loved and honored God and did what was right in God's sight.
\tqe The Holy Spirit was in him. (25)
\tqe [He probably was quite old. (26)]
\bttq Who was Simeon waiting to see before he died?
\tqe He was waiting to see the one who would console/encourage/help Israel in the midst of/out of its troubles, that is the Christ/Messiah/savior whom God would send. (25-26)
\bttq How did Simeon know he would not die before he saw the Christ/(the Messiah)?
\tqe The Holy Spirit had revealed that to him. (26)
\bttq Why did Simeon go to the temple grounds that particular day?
\tqe The Holy Spirit caused him to go there. (27)
\bttq What did Simeon see there?
\tqe He saw the parents (Joseph and Mary) bring their baby, Jesus, into the temple grounds [to do what the Law of Moses said that they must do]. (27)
\bttq When Simeon saw the family, what did he do?
\tqe He received/held the baby Jesus in his arms and blessed/praised God [for sending him]. (28)
\tqref LUK 2.29-32
\bttq Simeon had not died before seeing the savior, just as God had revealed to him. What did Simeon say about how he felt now?
\tqe His was ready to die, because he had peace in his heart./God could allow him to die because he had peace in his heart. (29)
\bttq What did Simeon say caused him to have a peaceful heart?
\tqe He had seen the one through whom God would save his people, Israel, and all [other] ethnic groups./He had seen the one whom God had sent to save people from all ethnic groups. (30-32)
\bttq In what way, do you think, is Jesus like a light for the Israelites/Jews and for all the people who are not Jews? (32)
\tqe In the same way that light allows us to see what is in a dark place, when a person learns about Jesus's work as his savior, that person knows clearly what must happen in order for him to be saved from his sins.
\tqe The people of Israel already knew much about God, but now they would understand even more about him.
\tqe The people who were/are not Jews would really see the contrast between the way they lived before they knew about God and the life the savior made possible for them. It would be as if Jesus had turned on a light for them to see better.

\tqe They were amazed that he knew so much about the work Jesus would do. (33)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They were amazed that God had revealed some of the same things to Simeon about their baby that the angel had told them. (33)
\an (Note: They did not know any normal reason why Simeon should know these things without God showing them to him. It seemed very strange to them.)
\bttq What did Simeon do then?
\tqe He asked God to bless them and then spoke to Mary. (34)
\an (Note: The Greek text literally says "Simeon blessed them", but that means that he asked God to bless them. There are many other blessings which people spoke in the Bible which make this custom of giving a blessing clear to us.)
\bttq What, do you think, is the meaning of this picture language about many Israelite people falling and others rising because of Jesus?
\tqe Those Israelites who do not accept Jesus as their savior sent by God will fall away. That means that they will be separated from God and be a part of those people whose bad actions will lead to God destroying them (for all time to come).
\tqe Those others who do accept Jesus as their savior will rise above the sin of this world. That means that they will be separated from the bad things in this world and will be joined with God (for all time to come). (34)
\bttq What kind of a sign do you think that Jesus was to be? (Note: Any of these answers is good.)
\tqe People would see and realize that God's promises about sending a savior were being fulfilled in what Jesus said and did. (34)
\tqe He is the one through whom God shows the way for a person to be saved. 
\tqe In Jesus, people would see God beginning to rule and reign in people's lives and they would also see how they were to live.
\bttq How would people respond to seeing this sign of Jesus in the world?
\tqe Many (people) would say bad things about Jesus (and things he would teach). (34)
\bttq What will happen to the many people who say or think bad things about this sign from God?
\tqe Their real thoughts would be clearly seen and would show that they were rejecting God and his plan to save them. (35a)
\bttq How will the action of people rejecting Jesus's life and work affect his mother, Mary?
\tqe She would feel great sorrow/anguish in her heart like the pain she would feel if someone pierced it with a sword. (35b)

\rf Luke 2:36-38 Anna spoke about the baby Jesus.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 2.36-38
\bttq What happened while Simeon was holding the baby Jesus and speaking to his parents?
\tqe [The woman/widow] Anna came up to them and thanked God for [sending] the child [to be the savior/Messiah].
\tqe She also told about this child to people who were waiting for God to set free the people [of Israel, represented here by those] living in Jerusalem. (38)
\bttq What do you think that we are to learn from what Luke wrote about Anna being at the temple?
\tqe God's Spirit showed her also (36a) that the baby Jesus was the one God had sent to set free the people [of Israel]. (38).
\tqe -OR-
\tqe It was not just the man Simeon who realized that baby Jesus was the savior [that God had promised to send].
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Anna was another person who spread the good news that Jesus was the savior, starting already when he was only a few weeks old. (38)

\tqe Her father was Phanuel and they had descended from Asher [one of Jacob's/Israel's sons].
\tqe She had married and then lived with her husband for 7 years [until he died]. (36)
\tqe After that, she was a widow and was now 84 years old.
\tqe She served/worshipped God by means of fasting and praying at the temple grounds from morning until night/all day long. (37)
\tqe (She, too, seems to have been waiting for God to send the one who would free his people [38].)
\bttq What do you think that Anna did when she fasted?
\tqe Key Term Check: She chose to not eat food for certain periods of time so that she could focus her thoughts better on God and not on her bodily needs. She especially used that time to pray and show that she was sorry for her sins.

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 2.39-40
\bttq What do you think that we are to learn from what Luke wrote about the family returning to Nazareth?
\tqe Luke told Theophilus at the beginning of this book (1:1-4) that he wanted to present a true account of Jesus's life. Since Mary and Joseph had come to Bethlehem for having their names recorded, it would be natural for them to return home to Nazareth.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus did not grow up in his forefather King David's village of Bethlehem, nor in Jerusalem, where the temple of God was. He appeared to be an ordinary child in an ordinary family in an ordinary village.
\an (Note: People would have to accept him based on the way he lived and what he taught, not on his social status, which would be based on who his ancestors were or on his religious education.)
\dh Details

\rf Luke 2:41-52 The boy Jesus went with his parents to the temple in Jerusalem.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 2.41-52
\bttq What do you think that we are to learn from what Luke wrote about the boy Jesus going to the temple in Jerusalem?
\tqe Luke wanted the reader to know that Jesus was very wise, even at that early age. He knew the work God had given him [to be the savior]. (49)
\tqe Everyone who heard Jesus speak realized that he was very wise and that he wanted to please God. (47, 52)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 2.41-45
\bttq What was the reason that Jesus's parents went again to Jerusalem?
\tqe It was their custom to go there every year to celebrate the Feast of the Passover. (41-42)
\an (Note: Every Jew was to go to the temple in Jerusalem once a year. Many people chose to go at the time for this feast.)
\bttq What do you know about this Jewish feast?
\tqe Key Term Check: This feast was to remember how God's angel passed over the homes of the Jews when they were slaves in Egypt. The angel passed over them because they had put the blood of a perfect lamb on their doorposts as a sign. The Egyptians did not do as God had said, so the angel killed the oldest son and the firstborn animal young in every such house. Because of that, the Egyptian ruler allowed the Jews to leave Egypt and return to the land God had promised to them. (See "The Passover sacrifice" in KBT in the "sacrifice, offering, blood" entry.)
\bttq How old was Jesus when he went with his parents?
\tqe 12 years old. (42)
\an (Note: A footnote may be good here to indicate that this was the age at which Jewish boys and girls began to be considered/called adult men and women. As adults they had to do all the religious activities that God told the Jews to do, such as to worship in Jerusalem during the Feast of the Passover.)
\bttq What did Jesus and his parents do when the Feast days were finished?
\tqe While his parents started to return home to Nazareth, Jesus stayed in Jerusalem. (43-44)
\bttq Why were Mary and Joseph not worried about Jesus staying by himself in the big city?
\tqe They did not know that Jesus had stayed there. (43) They thought that he was with other people in the [large] group who were traveling together [towards Nazareth]. (44)
\bttq How much time passed before they really started to look for him?
\tqe They traveled one whole day and then started to look for him. (44)
\bttq Where did his parents look for him?
\tqe They looked for him among their relatives and friends [who also were traveling that direction]. (44)
\bttq What did they do when they did not find Jesus among those people?
\tqe They returned to Jerusalem to look for him there. (45)

\bttq What did his mother say to him about all this?
\tqe "Son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been very worried as we have been searching for you!" (48)
\an (Note: When you translate the words "your father" to refer to Joseph, follow the custom of the people who will use this translation. Use the words normally used by a mother when she speaks to her children about her husband. Because Joseph was not the true physical father of Jesus, some languages may require a translator to use a word similar to "stepfather".)
\bttq Do the words of her question show that she was upset and frustrated, or do they show that she wanted Jesus to answer her question?
\tqe (Note: Her words should show that she was upset and frustrated. They should show or imply disapproval and finding fault with him.)
\tqref LUK 2.49-50
\bttq Jesus had not been with his parents for three days. What do you think was the reason that he asked his mother, "Why did you have to look for me?"
\tqe If they had thought about the reason that God had sent him into the world to do his (God's) work, they would have known that he would be in God's house, the temple. (49)
\bttq Did his answer help them understand the reason that he had stayed there in Jerusalem?
\tqe No, it did not. (50)
\tqref LUK 2.51-52

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 3.1-6
\bttq What do you think that we are to learn from what Luke wrote about John the Baptizer's work?
\tqe Luke wanted to show us that John began the work of getting people's hearts ready to hear and obey Jesus's message, just as the angel (1:16-17) and the Holy Spirit (1:76-79) had told Zechariah that John would do.
\dh Details

\bttq What kind of work did the men Tiberius (Caesar), Pontius Pilate, his brother Philip and Lysanias all do?
\tqe They were all high government officials [in areas where the Romans had authority]. (1)
\an (Note: Tiberius was the highest Roman official and lived in Rome. The other men were officials under him in the regions around Jerusalem.)
\bttq What kind of work did the men Annas and Caiaphas do?
\tqe They were high priests [in Jerusalem]. (2)
\bttq What happened to John during the time when all those men were the leaders of the people?
\tqe God told John to start his work. (2)
\bttq Where was John living when God told him to start his special work?
\tqe He was living in an uninhabited area/the wilderness/desert. (2)
\tqref LUK 3.3-6
\bttq What did John do in all the area around the Jordan River?
\an He preached that people were to repent and then be baptized. (3)
\an (Note: The key terms "preach" and "repent" are discussed here, but "baptize" will be checked below in vs. 7.)
\bttq If a person preaches in your/a village, what does he do?
\tqe (Accept any answer. Probable answers:
\tqe He teaches more of the parts of the Bible to the people who believe the talk about Jesus.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He harangues the believers to behave better than they have been doing.)
\an (Note: Neither of these two actions is what the Bible called preaching. When one of the above answers is given, if at all possible, the translator should use other words appropriate to the action found in the verse in the GNT and not automatically use the church word for "preach".)
\bttq What do you think that John actually did in those places when he "preached"? 
\tqe Key Term Check: John spoke out with authority to tell some news (that God had sent the savior he had promised to them). In this verse, he also was telling the people how they could respond appropriately to that news.
\an (Note: In the GNT, preaching was always done to people who had not yet heard the message. In English translations, three different Greek words are all translated "preach". In this verse the Greek word focuses on the aspect of telling with authority.)
\bttq What does a person do when he repents?
\tqe Key Term Check: He deliberately stops doing the sinful ways that please himself and changes to doing those ways which please God and are right in God's sight. (See "repent" in KBT.)
\bttq Why did people repent?
\tqe They wanted God to forgive/remove their sins. (3)
\bttq What had the prophet Isaiah written about this many years before John and Luke were born?
\tqe He had written that someone would preach in the wilderness that people were to get ready to accept the one whom God would send to save them. (4-6)
\bttq How were those people to get ready for this?
\tqe They were to correct/change their lives from living in bad ways to living in ways that pleased God. (They were to do whatever was necessary to get rid of their bad ways, like men straighten and level bad places in a path/road.) (4-5)
\bttq Why did Luke quote these words which the prophet Isaiah had written?
\tqe He wanted to show the readers that John was doing what Isaiah said that someone would do before the savior arrived. (2b-4)

\rf Luke 3:7-20 John the Baptizer preached his message to the people.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 3.7-20
\bttq What did Luke write about in these verses?
\tqe He wrote about what John said to different groups of people, especially to those who came to him in order for him to baptize them.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 3.7-9
\bttq How many people came to where John was staying in that uninhabited area/wilderness/desert?
\tqe Crowds of people. (7)
\bttq Why did so many people go to see John?
\tqe They wanted John to baptize them. (7)
\bttq What do you think that John did with the people when he baptized them?
\tqe Key Term Check: He did something so that water washed over the people either by putting them down under the water or by putting water over the top of them, probably the first way (Mark 1:9-10). (See "baptize, baptism" in KBT.)
\bttq With what did John compare these people?
\tqe He said they were [like] a group of poisonous snakes. (7)
\bttq What does it mean in your language if one person calls another person a (poisonous) snake?
\an (Note: The translation should reflect an insulting put-down by John. Some bad characteristic of poisonous snakes should be implied, such as their being sly, deceiving, or deadly. It should not be anything that is regarded as speaking well of a person.)
\bttq What were those people doing which reminded John of snakes?
\tqe [By coming to be baptized, they thought that they were tricking John/God. They wanted him to think that they had already repented of their sins, but they had not repented.] They hoped that in this way they could escape God being angry about their sins and ready to punish them as they deserved. (7) 
\bttq John called the people a bunch of young snakes who had descended from other snakes. Who do you think those people were, who showed/taught them to act like they were doing?
\tqe They were their parents, -OR-
\tqe the leaders of the Jews, -OR-
\tqe even the devil, who is the chief evil spirit. (7)
\an (Note: In other places in the Bible, the devil used the form of a snake to deceive people [Gen. 3 and 2 Cor. 11:3]. Jesus later said that the devil was their father, and called him the Father of Lies [John 8:44].)
\bttq If those people did not want God to punish them for their sins, John told them one thing they must do and one thing they must not do. What were those two things?
\tqe He said that their actions must show that they really had repented/changed. (8a)
\tqe Also, they must not think that, because they were descendants of Abraham, God would not punish them for their sins. (8b)
\bttq Why did John say that they must not trust in their being descendants of Abraham to keep God from punishing them?
\tqe He said that, if God only wanted a large number of descendants from Abraham, he could change ordinary stones into more descendants. [That meant that God did not need those particular people for any reason.] (8)
\bttq In verse 9 John used the picture language of a tree and its fruit, an ax at the tree's roots and a fire. What do you think these things represent?
\tqe The tree represents a person.
\tqe The tree's good fruit represents activities the person does which please God.
\tqe People use an ax to cut down fruit trees which do not produce good fruit. John said the ax was already close to the tree roots. When roots are cut, the tree's life is totally ended. Likewise, God is ready to punish/destroy a person because he/she is bad. That will be the end of that person's life.
\tqe The fire represents how that unproductive tree will be destroyed, which suggests the fire of hell for such a person.
\bttq Which type of people did John picture as being ready to burn in hell?
\tqe They were the people who had not repented,
\tqe and/or they were trusting in their ancestry (who their ancestors were) to save them. (See 3:8.)

\bttq What did John tell the people they should do to show that they had truly repented?
\tqe They should be ready to share their clothing and food with those who have [little or] none. (11)
\bttq What did John tell the men who collected taxes that they should do to show that they had truly repented?
\tqe They should not collect more money from people than the true amount of tax the people owed [to the Roman government]. (13)
\bttq What did John tell the soldiers they should do?
\tqe They should be satisfied with their pay. That is, they should not physically force anyone to give them money. (14)
\tqe They also should not say that if the person would not give them money, they would falsely accuse that person in court [so that person would get into trouble or be put in the jail]. (14)
\tqref LUK 3.15-18
\bttq What do you think that the Jewish people were waiting for and thinking might be happening?
\tqe They were waiting for the Christ/Messiah to come and set them free from their troubles. (15)
\bttq What were all the people thinking about John in this regard?
\tqe They were seriously wondering if John himself was the Christ. (15)
\bttq How did John answer them concerning whether or not he was the Christ/Messiah?
\tqe He himself was not the Christ/Messiah. The Christ/Messiah would have much greater power and authority than he himself had. (16-17)
\bttq How did John show that the Christ would do greater work than he himself was doing?
\tqe The Christ would baptize people with the Holy Spirit and fire, not just with water as John did.
\tqe John did not feel he even was important enough to be the servant who might assist Christ by untying his sandals. (16)
\tqe John pictured the Christ as having authority to save and to punish people. (He himself did not have such authority.) (17)
\bttq What do you think it means that Christ will baptize people with the Holy Spirit and with fire?
\tqe Those whom Christ causes to repent will receive his Holy Spirit into their hearts,
\tqe but Christ will throw those who do not repent into the fires of hell to destroy them. (17)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The Christ would cause people who repent to come under the influence of God's Holy Spirit. The Spirit would get rid of all that was not good in their lives just as a fire does with grass and sticks. (17)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Baptism with water is only an outward, ritual cleaning to show what we want to happen in our inner being. The Christ will truly clean/cleanse one's inner being by means of his Holy Spirit and remove impurities as fire does. (16-17)
\bttq What is the work of the winnowing fork in the picture language John used?
\tqe People use it to separate all the rubbish from the good grain. (17)
\bttq What, do you think, are the good things and the bad things that the Christ will be separating?
\tqe Christ will separate the good people from the bad people. Those people who repent and believe in him are good. Christ will separate them from those people who do not repent.
\bttq What do you think will happen to those people whom he calls good?
\tqe He will gather them [into heaven] where he wants to keep them, as a farmer gathers the wheat and stores it in a safe place. (17)
\bttq What do you think will happen to those people whom he calls bad?
\tqe They will be burned up/destroyed in the never-ending fires [of hell], as a farmer burns the rubbish parts of the wheat and grass. (17)
\bttq In verse 18 Luke wrote that John kept on urging/strongly requesting [the people to repent of their sins] and that he preached the Good News to them. If people will be punished in the fires of hell, that does not sound like good news. What was the good news that John preached?
\tqe Key Term Check: The Good News was that the Christ, the one whom God had promised would come to save his people, was already among them. If they repented and prepared their hearts to accept the savior, God would not throw them into the fires of hell. (See "gospel" in KBT.)
\an (Note: If the language of the translation allows for it, try to use the terminology you have here for "good news" back in 1:19 and 2:10 also. Those two references are a bit more general, but they do still apply to the Good News of the savior having come.)
\tqe Key Term Check: The words "preached the Good News" in English translations are actually only one word in Greek. The word literally means, "he Good News-ed". The focus is on what he preached, not how he did it.  See the discussion above at 3:3.
\tqref LUK 3.19-20
\bttq Why did John rebuke Herod, the king?
\tqe Herod had done something bad with his brother's wife, Herodias, as well as having done other bad actions. (19)
\bttq What other bad action did Herod do then?
\tqe He [sent men and had them] put John into prison. (20)

\tqe John the Baptizer did (Matt. 3:13-15; Mark 1:9).
\bttq Did John baptize Jesus before he was in the prison, or after being there?
\tqe John did it before he was in the prison.
\an (Note: John died while he was in the prison [Mark 6:14-29]. Try to show in either verse 20 or 21 that the activities in 3:21-22 happened before the activities in vs. 20.
\an You may want to put verses 19-20 into one section with verses 21-22. Number these verses together as 19-22, and mention Jesus's baptism [from 21-22] first, followed by Herod putting John in prison [from 19-20].)
\bttq What happened while John baptized Jesus and then Jesus was praying?
\tqe [God] opened heaven/the sky (21) and the Holy Spirit came down upon him in a bodily form like a dove. Also, God spoke [to Jesus] from heaven. (22)
\bttq Do Luke's words sound as though this was a vision Jesus saw, or do the words sound as though this really happened?
\tqe The words, "in a bodily form," show that it really happened. (22) (See John 1:32-34.)

\rf Luke 3:23-38 These were the ancestors of Jesus.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 3.23-38
\bttq What do you think that we are to learn from what Luke wrote about Jesus's ancestors?
\tqe He showed the Jews (and us) that Jesus was the Messiah that the prophets had said would come, because he had the same ancestors, such as David and Abraham, as the prophets had said the Messiah would have.
\tqe He showed us that Jesus was a true human being like us.
\dh Details
\bttq How old was Jesus when he began his work of preaching the Good News?
\tqe He was about 30 years old. (23)
\bttq Does this listing sound like the way other people who speak your language would tell you about their own list of ancestors?
\tqe (It should. This listing should follow the traditional way of listing one's ancestors.)
\bttq Whom did people think was the father of Jesus?
\tqe Joseph. (23)
\bttq Whom did Luke name as the true/original ancestor of Jesus?
\tqe God. (38)
\bttq Which names in the list do you remember from other parts of the Bible?
\tqe (They may not remember any of the names, but most likely they will know Old Testament events about (King) David and his father Jesse [31-32], or
\tqe Jacob and his father Isaac [34], or
\tqe Isaac and his father Abraham [34], or
\tqe Shem and his father Noah [36], or
\an Seth and his father Adam [38]. They may even mention that God had created Adam [38].
\an The point is to check whether the assistant understands these names to be names of real people or assumes them to be mythological characters or spirit beings.)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 4.1-13
\bttq Luke wrote about the time when the devil came to Jesus. What do you think that we are to learn from that?
\tqe The devil tried to make Jesus disobey God, but Jesus would not disobey.
\tqe If Jesus had obeyed the devil, he would have been as sinful as we are. Then he could not have been the one to save all of us who sin.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus had human feelings just as we do. When he had not eaten for forty days, he was very hungry. The devil tried to make Jesus obey him instead of obeying God, but Jesus did not obey the devil.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 4.1-4
\bttq Why did Jesus go into an uninhabited area/into the wilderness/desert?
\tqe The Holy Spirit caused him to go there. (1)
\bttq Who is the devil whom Luke wrote about here?
\tqe Key Term Check: He is the chief of the evil spirits, the enemy of God and God's people. (See "Satan" in KBT.)
\bttq What did the devil try to do with Jesus there?
\tqe He tempted Jesus [to sin]./He tried to make Jesus obey him and disobey God. (2)
\bttq What does it mean to tempt another person?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that one person tries to make the other obey him to do something which disobeys higher authorities, such as parents, the government, or God. (2)
\bttq Why was Jesus hungry?
\tqe He had not eaten during the forty days he had been staying there. (2)
\bttq How did the devil try to use this hunger of Jesus to make Jesus obey him?
\tqe He told Jesus to prove that he was the son of God by changing a stone into food. (3)
\bttq How did Jesus respond to him?
\tqe He spoke words which were written [by Moses in the book of God's Words]. He said that eating food is not the only or most important thing in life. (4)  [He did not obey the devil.]
\tqref LUK 4.5-8
\bttq What did the devil show to Jesus from a high place?
\tqe He showed him all the nations of the world at one time. (5)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the devil took Jesus to a high place?
\tqe He wanted to show Jesus how much authority/power he had over the whole world.
\tqe He hoped to entice Jesus to follow him.
\bttq How did the devil tempt Jesus when they looked at all those kingdoms/nations all over the world?
\tqe He said that if Jesus would worship him, he would give Jesus all authority [to rule] over the kingdoms/nations/people.
\tqe He would also give Jesus all the glory/honor that a person would receive because he had that authority. (5-7)
\bttq What do you think that a person does when he worships another person?
\tqe Key Term Check: He shows great honor and deep respect for the other person. He acts as though that person has more authority or strength or wisdom or goodness or beauty than any other human, and so is like God. (See L&N entry 53.14 and those at 53.53-64.)
\bttq Who do you think gave the devil the authority over the kingdoms/nations/people?
\tqe God did before the devil disobeyed God and God made him leave heaven.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe God had given that authority to the first people, Adam and his wife, Eve. But they obeyed the devil, rather than what God had told them to do. In that way they gave that authority to the devil.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe No one had given that authority to the devil. He lied about it to Jesus.
\bttq How did Jesus respond to the devil this time?
\tqe He spoke words which were written [by Moses in the book of God's Words]. He said that everyone is to worship and serve only the Lord [who is] God. (8)  [He did not obey the devil.]
\tqref LUK 4.9-13
\bttq How did the devil tempt Jesus the third time?
\tqe He said that Jesus should prove that he was the son of God by jumping off the highest point of the temple and falling to the ground. (He even partially quoted Psalm 91:11-12 to back up his dare.) (9)
\bttq How would this prove that Jesus was God's son?
\tqe Because God would tell his angels to watch over him, he would not hurt himself. (9)
\bttq How did Jesus respond to him this time?
\tqe He spoke words which were written [by Moses in the book of God's Words]. He said that no one is to tempt/test God. (12)  [He did not obey the devil.]
\bttq What do you think it means to test God? (12)
\tqe A person tries to cause God to do what that person wants to happen. The person wants God to feel as though he (God) must do this action in order to show that he is more powerful than the problem the person created.
\bttq Jesus's answers stopped the devil from tempting him more. Where did Jesus always get his answers?
\tqe The answers were all in God's Word [which men had written down long ago]. (4, 8, 12)
\bttq What did the devil do after Jesus would not obey him those three times?
\tqe He left Jesus and waited for another time to try again later. (13)

\rf Luke 4:14-30 The people of Nazareth rejected Jesus.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 4.14-30
\bttq What can we learn from what Luke wrote about the ways that people responded to Jesus's preaching?
\tqe People who lived all over Galilee [province] heard about him (14) and praised him (15). From the words of Isaiah (21), the people could see that Jesus was that person whom God had promised to send [as the savior]. However, the people of his hometown would not accept him as sent by God (24). This was because they thought of him as being only a local man whom they had seen grow up (22).
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 4.14-15
\bttq Back in verse 1 when Jesus went into the wilderness/desert, he was led by the Holy Spirit and had all the power of the Holy Spirit. What did Luke write about this at the time Jesus left that uninhabited area?
\tqe He returned to Galilee [province] completely guided by the Holy Spirit's power (just as when he went into the desert). (14)
\bttq What did Jesus do there in Galilee [province]?
\tqe He taught in the people's synagogues around the area. (15)
\an (Note: There is a strong implication that Jesus also had been doing miracles, such as healing people. That is implied from the words "power of the Spirit" and "news about him spread", as well as Jesus later stating that the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled in the work he was doing.)
\bttq What do you think a synagogue was?
\tqe Key Term Check: A synagogue was a building which the Jews built in order to gather for hearing someone read and teach from the Word of God and where they could worship him. Many Jews lived too far away from the temple in Jerusalem to walk there regularly for worship, so they built a synagogue in each village for that purpose. (See "synagogue" in KBT.)
\bttq How did the people around Galilee [province] respond to Jesus?
\tqe The news about him spread all around (14).
\tqe All those who heard him teach praised him (15).
\tqref LUK 4.16-17
\bttq Why did Jesus go into the synagogue in Nazareth?
\tqe That was the village where [Mary and Joseph] had raised him.
\tqe He customarily went there every Sabbath Day [to worship God]. (16)
\bttq What do you think makes a particular day be the Sabbath Day?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is the seventh day of the week, Saturday, the day on which God rested from his work of creating the world. He told people to honor him on that day by resting from their work/by not working. The Jews used that day to meet together to worship God. (See "Sabbath" in KBT.)
\bttq Why did Jesus stand up in the synagogue?
\tqe It was the customary way for a person to show that he wanted to read [God's Word]. (16)
\bttq Take a piece of paper and show me what Jesus did in order to get ready to read.
\tqe (The person who is answering these questions may have to roll up the piece of paper first before unrolling it and holding it at a proper distance for reading from it. Jewish Scripture writings happen to be rolled side-to-side, not top-to-bottom, but that is not the key part of the action you want to see happen.)
\an (Note: A footnote or glossary entry may be needed to indicate that long ago people wrote on long pieces of paper or thin animal skin which they kept safe by rolling each one around a wooden rod. In order to read the words, the paper or skin had to be unrolled to find the place where one was to begin reading.)
\bttq Which part of God's Word did Jesus open?
\tqe He opened/unrolled the part that the prophet Isaiah had written. (17)
\bttq After Jesus had opened the scroll/book/papers, what did he do? (17-18)
\tqe He read part of what Isaiah had written there.
\tqref LUK 4.18-19
\bttq To whom, do you think, was Isaiah referring when he wrote "me" in these two verses?
\tqe (Isaiah was not speaking about himself. He was referring to a special Servant of the Lord whom God would send to the Jews. That special person would say these words to the Jews. The Jews already understood that servant would be the Messiah whom God had promised to send to them. We know from verse 21 that this special person was Jesus himself, but Isaiah did not know Jesus's name when he wrote these words.)
\an (Note: The translator may need make this explicit at the end of verse 17 in the introduction to the quote, such as, "... where it is written about the special Servant of the Lord, ...").
\bttq What did Isaiah say this special person would do?
\tqe He was to tell/preach the Good News [that God's plan to save them was taking place right then] to the poor people. (18b)
\tqe He was to proclaim [with authority]/preach to the people whose lives were as if they had been captured [by the devil and their own sins] that they could be free [of those things]. (18c)
\tqe He was to proclaim [with authority]/preach to the blind people that they could see again. (18c)
\tqe He was to free those who had been treated unfairly. (18d)
\tqe He was to proclaim [with authority]/preach that the time when the Lord would show kindness to his people [had come]. (19)
\an (Note: Has the reference to the Good News been translated in the same way here (4:18b) as it was in 3:18? It should be clearly referring to the same thing both there and here.)
\bttq How would that special person know he was supposed to do that work?
\tqe God's Spirit had or would anoint him by coming on/to him in a special way (18a).
\bttq What does it mean to anoint someone?
\tqe Key Term Check: Someone having great authority appoints another person to do a special kind of work on his behalf. That person with authority usually shows this by pouring or rubbing an oil or ointment onto the other person's head. In the Bible times people most often used olive oil to appoint and dedicate a new prophet, priest or king. The focus here is on the appointing function, not on the pouring on of oil. (See "anoint" in KBT.)
\bttq How would that person be able to do all those difficult things?
\tqe God's Spirit would make him able to do those things. (18)
\tqref LUK 4.20-22
\bttq When Jesus had finished reading part of Isaiah's words written on the paper/scroll, what did he do with that scroll? 
\tqe He rolled it up and gave it back to the man who looked after the writings. (20)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that everyone there was watching him?
\tqe Because he sat down (as was the custom for a teacher to do), they now expected him to teach them about that text [or even to do some of those things he had read about]. (20)
\bttq What did Jesus say about those words which he had read from the book by Isaiah?
\tqe They were now coming true as they heard him speak them [because he was the one about whom Isaiah had written, the one whom God had anointed/chosen to do these things]. (21) (See "Scripture" in KBT.)
\bttq How did the people think of him at first?
\tqe They thought and spoke well of him and were amazed at his very good way of speaking/the wonderful things he said. (22) 
\bttq Why were they amazed by his speaking ability?
\tqe They knew him as [the carpenter] Joseph's son, [just a local boy with no special schooling]. (22) (They did not know any normal reason why he should know so much about God's Word.)
\tqref LUK 4.23-27
\bttq What does this proverb, "Doctor, first make yourself well!", mean in regard to Jesus?
\tqe Since he had done miracles in Capernaum [and other places in the general area], he must do the same things right there in his hometown. This would show everyone that he really was the person about whom the prophet Isaiah had written.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe If a person who claimed to be a doctor was able to cure himself, then what he claimed would be true. In the same way, if Jesus could do miracles, then what he claimed [as being sent by God] would also be true. (23)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus's response to them means?
\tqe A prophet is not accepted by the people in his hometown because they know him and think of him as the same kind of person as themselves. They think he is not able to teach them anything they do not already know about God.
\tqe Jesus knew that these people did not accept that he was a prophet. He also knew that they did not accept that he was the Christ. Therefore, they would not be able to accept or believe what he said or did right there in front of them. 
\bttq What caused the Jews to suffer long ago when Elijah lived in Israel?
\tqe There was no rain for 3 1/2 years. That caused a severe famine. (25)
\bttq There were many widows in Israel at that time who had great trouble finding food. To whom did God send Elijah?
\tqe He sent Elijah to a widow who lived in the town of Zarephath. Zarephath was near the city of Sidon [outside the land of Israel]. (26)
\bttq There were many people sick with leprosy/bad skin disease in Israel when Elisha lived. Whom did God bring to Elisha to be made well?
\tqe Naaman, a man from the country of Syria. (27)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus was talking about when he said that Naaman was made "clean"?
\tqe Key Term Check: He was talking about Naaman having clear skin again after he was well.
\tqe He was also talking about the kind of cleanness God required before a person could be allowed into the public worship or allowed to live with his family again. (See "clean" in KBT.)
\an (Note: If a very general word like "clean" is being used in the translation, make sure it does not refer only to removing external things like dirt or general illness from the body.)
\an (Note: This is the same Greek word which was used in 2:22 when Mary needed to become "clean" again following childbirth. However, the language of the translation may have separate names for each of these situations due to the male-female distinction or due to blood being involved in one case and not in the other. The words in the translation must be appropriate to each of these references.)
\bttq How do the two examples from the Old Testament scripture show that what Jesus was saying about prophets was true?
\tqe The people of Israel did not accept/believe two of their greatest prophets, Elijah and Elisha. Their own people did not accept them as men who spoke for God, so God used them to do his work among other people, some non-Jews who did believe them. (25-27)
\bttq Thinking about these two examples, if the Nazareth people would not accept Jesus as the Christ, what do you think that he would do?
\tqe He would go to other places, (as Elijah and Elisha had done,) where the people would accept him as a prophet/the Christ.
\tqref LUK 4.28-30
\bttq What was the people's response when they heard Jesus say those things in verses 23-27?
\tqe They were full of anger/furious. (28)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that they were so angry about what Jesus had said?
\tqe They knew that he was implying that they were not believing, just as the Jews had done in the time when Elijah and Elisha were prophets.
\tqe They felt that he was rejecting them and would go to other places to teach God's word and do great things [by God's power] among people who would accept him. He might even go to people who were not Jews.
\bttq What did those people do to Jesus?
\tqe They [angrily] removed him [from the synagogue and on] out of their town. They took/led him to an edge of the hill on which their town was built, intending to throw him over that edge/cliff [to kill him]. (29)
\an (Note: The town was not on the top of the hill. It was on the side of a hill which has some steep edges at the top. People think that is where the townspeople took Jesus.)
\bttq Why were they not able to do what they intended to do?
\tqe Because Jesus walked through the middle of the crowd and went on his way, the people did not get to push him over the edge.(30)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that he was able to do that?
\tqe  God's Spirit and power helped him.

\tqe They were greatly astounded/astonished. (32, 36)
\tqe They talked about it among themselves (36) and with others (37).
\bttq What happened that caused them to think like that?
\tqe Jesus spoke with so much authority and power that even demons/evil spirits obeyed what he told them to do. (32, 36)  (They realized that God must be helping him do those things.)
\dh Details
\bttq What did Jesus do on the Sabbath Day when he was in the town of Capernaum?
\tqe He was teaching [God's Word to] the people in the synagogue. (31)
\bttq Why did a man in the synagogue shout loudly at Jesus?
\tqe He had a demon, that is, an unclean/evil spirit, in him. (33)
\bttq What do the people who speak your language say are the characteristics/signs to know a spirit is a demon/an evil spirit?
\tqe Key Term Check: A demon is a spirit that only does evil things and tries to cause trouble for people, especially those who want to obey God's Word. The demon obeys Satan and opposes what God has said. (Notice that Luke called the same spirit by both names in this verse.)
\tqe (See "evil spirit, unclean spirit, demon" and "unclean, defiled, impure, uncleanness" in KBT.)
\bttq What did the demon in this man know about Jesus?
\tqe He knew that Jesus was a man from the town of Nazareth. (34)
\tqe He knew that Jesus had power and authority to destroy/get rid of him [and other spirits who were in the man]. (34)
\tqe He knew that Jesus was the holy one who had come from God. (34)
\bttq How did Jesus make the demon leave the man?
\tqe He sternly commanded/rebuked the spirit that it must stop what it was saying and doing, and now leave, and it did. (35)
\bttq Why were the people so astonished?
\tqe Jesus not only taught with authority, but even evil spirits obeyed his commands. (36)

\bttq How do we know that she was well quickly?
\tqe She immediately got up and served [food to] the people there. (39)
\bttq What happened later in that day as the sun was setting?
\tqe People brought everyone who was sick in some way to Jesus. [They wanted Jesus to heal the sick people.] (40)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the people waited until the sun was setting?
\tqe The Jewish laws did not permit people to travel or carry things on the Sabbath Day. A day ended when the sun set, and the new day began. Being a new day, people could then come and bring those who were sick.

\tqe He did not want people to think that he (Jesus) was associated with the evil spirits.

\tqe and then realize that he was the Christ, just as God had promised them.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Many Jews thought that the Messiah would set them free from the Roman government, not from sin, so they would misunderstand such words from the spirits.)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He did not want the Jewish leaders to turn against him and end his ministry before he had done everything that God had sent him to do.

\bttq Where did Jesus go the next day at daybreak?
\tqe He went out [from the town] to a place where he could be alone. (42)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the people were looking for him?
\tqe They wanted him to stay there, [perhaps to heal people when they were sick or to do other miracles]. (42)  (They may have thought that he had already left their town.)
\bttq Why did Jesus not stay there, but went to other towns, even as far away as the synagogues in Judea province?
\tqe God had sent him [down to earth] to tell/preach the Good News about the kingdom of God. (43, 44)
\tqe Key Term Check: The two words which are often translated "preach" in English translations are both here in one context. Verse 43 refers to the content of Jesus's message. Verse 44 refers to how he presented that Good News message, doing it "with authority".
\bttq What is the kingdom of God?
\tqe Key Term Check: God wants to rule over every person and reign in each one's heart and life as a king rules over the people who live in his country. The people in a kingdom submit to the king's rule, obeying his laws. God was establishing his kingship through his son, Jesus, whom he sent to the earth as the Messiah/the Christ he had promised to send. (See "kingdom of God" in KBT.)

\tqe saw that he had great power (9)
\tqe and then followed him (11).
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 5.1-3
\bttq Why were many people crowding around Jesus at the lakeside?
\tqe They all wanted to hear God's message which Jesus spoke. (1)
\bttq Why did Jesus get into a fishing boat?
\tqe He got into the boat in order to be out in front of the people and better teach them. (1, 3)
\bttq Who owned the boat in which Jesus sat?
\tqe Simon did. // Simon owned it. (3)
\bttq What were Simon and the other fishermen doing when Jesus asked to use Simon's boat?
\tqe They were washing out their [large] fishing nets. (2)
\tqref LUK 5.4-7
\bttq When Jesus had finished teaching the crowd, what did he tell Simon?
\tqe He told Simon to go catch fish out in the deep water of the lake. (4)
\bttq Why did Simon not want to go fishing at that time?
\tqe He and the other men had fished all night, but had caught nothing. (5)
\bttq Why would Simon try again to catch fish?
\tqe He respected Jesus, who had told him to do it. (5)
\bttq What happened when they obeyed Jesus's words?
\tqe They caught so many fish that their nets began to tear/break [from the weight]. (6)
\bttq How were they able to pull in those nets full of fish?
\tqe They motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. (7)
\bttq Why were both the boats about to sink?
\tqe The many fish filled both boats and were so heavy that the boats sat very low in the water. (7)
\tqref LUK 5.8-11
\bttq Who is this man named Peter?
\tqe He is Simon. It is another name for him. (8)
\an (Note: You may wish to have a footnote or glossary entry which indicates that Simon was also called Peter in the Greek language [John 1:40-42]. Simon was his Hebrew name.)
\bttq Show me what you think that Simon did when he "fell down at Jesus's knees".
\tqe (The translation assistant should kneel in front of someone or something which represents Jesus's legs. We do not know if Simon bowed his head or not, but that was a sign of honor to the person who was standing or sitting.)
\bttq Why did Simon fall down at Jesus's knees and tell him to go away from him?
\tqe He had seen Jesus use God's power and was astonished by it. Now he shows his submission to Jesus. He knew that he was a person who sinned [and that Jesus did not sin]. Simon probably felt unworthy to have one sent by God right there helping him. (8-9)
\bttq Other people also were astonished by this large number of fish they had caught. Who were they?
\tqe They included Simon's companions as well as his partners, James and John (who were sons of the man named Zebedee). (9-10)
\bttq What did Jesus say in response to Simon's words?
\tqe "Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men." (10)
\bttq What do you think that Simon would do to "catch men"?
\tqe He would not grab people with his hands or his fishing net. This is picture/figurative language. Simon would gather people, both men and women, by encouraging them to become believers in/followers of Jesus in God's kingdom.
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus said that Simon should not have been afraid of him or his power? (10)
\tqe They would be working together for the same purpose, not as enemies. Jesus had used his power to help, not to hurt or frighten anyone.
\bttq How did those men get ready to "catch men"?
\tqe They pulled their boats up on the shore, left everything there and followed Jesus. (11)
\tqe (Note: The meaning of "to follow Jesus" here includes both walking behind Jesus away from the boats at the lake and learning from him as they went everywhere together.)
\bttq How did the men catching so many fish helped them decide to follow Jesus? What do you think?
\tqe Simon saw that Jesus had real power and authority when he spoke or did something.
\tqe He recognized that it was power from God that he, as a normal, sinful human being, did not have. (8)
\tqe The men would learn more about that power and authority [and about Jesus's message] as they went around with him and listened to him teach.

\rf Luke 5:12-16 Jesus healed a man who was sick with leprosy/a bad skin disease.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 5.12-16
\bttq After Jesus healed the man who had leprosy/a bad skin disease, how did people respond?
\tqe The man having leprosy believed in Jesus and Jesus healed him. (13)
\tqe New crowds of people came to hear him [teach God's Word] and to have him heal them of their sicknesses. (15)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 5.12-13
\bttq How did Jesus and the man sick with leprosy/the bad skin disease meet?
\tqe Jesus was in the same town as the man. The man saw him there. (12)
\bttq What did the man do when he saw Jesus?
\tqe He quickly bowed low, putting his [knees and his] face to the ground [in front of Jesus] and pleaded with/appealed to Jesus to heal him so he would be [physically and ritually] clean. (12)
\bttq This man talked to Jesus as if he was not sure about something. Was he not sure that Jesus wanted to heal him or was he not sure that Jesus had enough power to heal him?
\tqe He was not sure that Jesus wanted to heal him. He knew Jesus had enough power. (12)
\bttq What do you think that the man was thinking about when he said, "Make me clean"?
\tqe Key Term Check: He was talking both about having clear skin again after he became well
\an and about becoming ritually clean. That means that the priests would allow him to once again be in the public worship and in the presence of God and to live with his family. (See 4:27, above.)
\bttq How did Jesus make the man well again?
\tqe He reached out and touched/put his hand on the sick man and told him he was healed. (13)
\an (Note: If a person allowed another who was sick with leprosy to be near him or to touch him, that was a culturally bad thing. It meant that the new person also was ritually unclean for a set amount of time. Therefore, no one wanted to touch a person with leprosy, but Jesus felt compassion for the man. The translator may want to have a glossary entry about the Jews' laws and taboos concerning leprosy [see Lev. 13-14].)
\tqref LUK 5.14-16
\bttq What was the man to do after Jesus healed him?
\tqe He was to go show his healed skin to a priest and then offer the sacrifices which Moses had commanded for a person who was healed of leprosy. (14)
\bttq What result did Jesus intend when he told the man to go to the priest?
\tqe He wanted the people/the priests to know for sure that the man was totally healed [and safe to be near]. (14)
\tqe (It would also show that Jesus followed/obeyed the Laws of Moses and told others to do the same.)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus commanded the man not to tell anyone about this?
\tqe He did not want people to become excited only about the things he did to help people.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He did not want the man to interact with other people before a priest declared him [ritually] clean.
\an (Note: If the person who is answering these questions already knows a lot about events in the four gospels, he may give one of the answers below. These answers are still true and acceptable, but they are not found in Luke's gospel up to this point.)
\an He did not want the people or the priests to think that he disregarded the Laws of Moses.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He did not want the priests to hear of the miracle before the man arrived. If they were hostile toward Jesus, they might decide not to say that the man was cured or ritually clean.
\bttq Jesus commanded the man not to say anything to anyone else. What happened anyway?
\tqe News about Jesus's teaching and miracles spread even more than before.
\tqe Crowds of people came to hear him [teach God's Word].
\tqe Many people wanted him to heal them of their sicknesses. (15)

\rf Luke 5:17-26 Jesus forgave the sins of a paralyzed man and healed him.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 5.17-26
\bttq Why did Jesus heal the paralyzed man?
\tqe He wanted everyone who was there to know that he had authority from God to forgive sins. Because they could not see that, he healed the sick man to show that God had given power to him. (24)
\bttq After Jesus healed that man, how did people respond?
\tqe Those people who believed in Jesus were helped (20, 25) and many praised God (25-26).
\tqe The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law/scribes criticized him (21).
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 5.17-20
\bttq Who had come to hear Jesus teach?
\tqe Pharisees and teachers of the Law had come from many places. (17)
\bttq What do you know about these two groups of men called the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law?
\tqe Key Term Check: The Pharisees were a group of Jewish religious leaders who also were very much like a political party. They followed the teaching of the experts in interpreting the Scriptures (who are often called scribes, or teachers of the Law). After those teachers of the Law had decided how a Jew was to live in order to please God, the Pharisees tried to live that way. They were very proud of themselves and thought that they were better than all the other people who did not live as they did.
\tqe The teachers of the Law were men who had authority to copy the writings of the Old Testament writers. They became the teachers and interpreters of the Old Testament Scriptures, especially the laws of God written down by Moses. Because of that work of writing, those men were called scribes. (See "Pharisee" and "scribe, teacher of the law" in KBT.)
\bttq What did Luke write about the power of God?
\tqe It was there with/in Jesus and available for him to heal [the sick people]. (17)
\bttq Why were some men coming, carrying another man on a mat/stretcher?
\tqe The man on the mat was paralyzed, and they believed that Jesus could heal him. (18, 20)
\bttq Tell me about the sickness of the man on the mat/stretcher.
\tqe The sick man could not move his legs and, perhaps, not his arms. It was as if those parts were dead. He could not walk or stand, so his friends carried him to Jesus.
\bttq When they came to the house, what did they try hard to do?
\tqe They tried hard to carry the sick man inside and lay him in front of Jesus. (18)
\bttq Why were they not able to do that?
\tqe There were many people in the house/in their way. (19)
\bttq What did they do in order to put the sick man in front of Jesus?
\tqe They went up onto the [flat] roof,
\tqe [removed some roofing material/tiles from] over the place where Jesus was
\tqe and lowered the mat on which the sick man lay. (19)
\bttq Why did Jesus decide to forgive the sick man's sins?
\tqe He saw [all the hard work the men had done to put the sick man in front of him, and knew] that they believed/had faith that he could heal the man. (20)
\bttq What was that faith which the men had?
\tqe The men trusted and were confident that something was true, even when it could not be seen. They trusted and were confident that, by the power of God, Jesus was able to heal their friend. (See "faith" in KBT in the "believe" entry.)
\tqref LUK 5.21-24
\bttq Why were the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law/scribes upset when Jesus said that he had forgiven the sick man's sins?
\tqe They did not believe that Jesus was God's son. Because only God can forgive sins, when Jesus forgave the man's sins, they wrongly thought that he was blaspheming God/pretending to be like God. Anyone who claimed to be God or to have God's authority was blaspheming God. (21)
\bttq What do you think that a person does when he blasphemes God?
\tqe Key Term Check: He claims to be equal with God in some way.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He speaks evil against God. He insults God and defames his name and character so that others will not honor or respect him.
\tqe (God had said that people should kill such a person [Lev. 24:16]).
\bttq How is it, do you think, that Jesus knew their thoughts? (22)
\tqe He was God's son and the Lord God's power was present with him (17).
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus implied that they should not have thought such things? (22)
\tqe The things that he had already taught and done should have proven to them that he had come from God and that God had given him authority both to forgive sins and to heal the sick. 
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They came expecting to hear Jesus teach God's Word clearly and do some miracles. Since he could only do those things by God's power, he could forgive sins by that same power, too.
\bttq What do you think is the answer to Jesus's question about whether it is easier to forgive sins or to heal a person who is paralyzed? (23)
\tqe Neither action is possible unless you are God. If Jesus could do one, he must be God, so he could do the other by using that same power.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe If you say you have power to forgive someone's sins, it may be just empty words, because no one can see whether it is true or not. However, if you say you have power to heal someone, everyone will see whether that happens or not. In that way, healing someone is harder to do, because everyone will see whether you are lying or not.
\bttq Whom was Jesus talking about when he spoke about the Son of Man?
\tqe He was speaking about himself. (24)
\tqe Key Term Check: This is a title used in the Old Testament in Dan. 7:13-14. Daniel was referring to a human figure who, nevertheless, is a being in heaven. God gave him authority to be the leader of God's people on earth. The teachers of the Law knew that this title referred to the Messiah. Jesus applied this title to himself. See "Son of Man" in KBT.
\bttq Why did Jesus tell the sick man to get up and leave?
\tqe He said that to the sick man in order that the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law would know that he had power from God to heal the man. Then they would know that he also had authority (from God/as God's son) to forgive sins. (24)
\tqref LUK 5.25-26
\bttq How did the people there know that Jesus had healed the man?
\tqe He stood up in front of them, took up his mat/bedding and went home praising God. (25)
\bttq What did those people think and do when they saw the man do that?
\tqe They all could hardly believe what they were seeing, and it caused them to have great respect for God and to praise him. They realized that they had seen unusual things happen right there in front of them. (26)

\tqe He left everything [related to his government work] and followed Jesus. He even hosted a banquet/feast in Jesus's honor. (27-29)
\bttq When Jesus ate food with many other people at Levi's house, how did the Pharisees and teachers of the Law/scribes respond?
\tqe They complained to his disciples. (30)
\bttq Why did Jesus come to this earth?
\tqe He came to call/invite people who know they sin to repent [of their sins]. (32)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 5.27-28
\bttq What work did Levi do?
\tqe He collected tax money [for the Roman government]. (27)
\an (Note: You may wish to have a footnote or glossary entry which indicates Levi was also called Matthew in the Greek language [Matt. 9:9-13]. Levi was his Hebrew name.)
\bttq Where was Levi when Jesus spoke to him?
\tqe He was sitting in a government office collecting taxes. (27)
\bttq What did Jesus ask Levi to do?
\tqe He asked Levi to follow him [and learn from him as they went everywhere together]. (27)
\bttq What did Levi do to show that he already believed in Jesus?
\tqe He got up, left everything [related to his work] and went with Jesus. (28)
\tqref LUK 5.29-32
\bttq How did Levi honor Jesus?
\tqe He made a great banquet/feast for Jesus. (29)
\bttq What other groups of people were also at this feast?
\tqe There was a large crowd of other men who collected taxes (29), some Pharisees and teachers of the Law/scribes (30), Jesus's disciples (30) and others (29) [whom the Pharisees and teachers of the Law regarded as sinners (30) ].
\bttq What kind of a person is a disciple?
\tqe Key Term Check: A disciple is a person who spends much time learning from someone who is wise. Usually the student follows the teacher everywhere he goes, listening to and discussing with the teacher everything he or she says. The disciple is like an apprentice, but is not learning craft skills. (See "disciple" in KBT.)
\bttq Who were Jesus's disciples at this time?
\tqe Luke has only written about Simon Peter, James, John (verse 11) and now Levi.
\an (Note: There probably were many other people who followed Jesus and may be included here. However, we only know the names of those twelve whom he called his apostles [Luke 6:12-16], and two others who were later considered to replace Judas as an apostle [Acts 1:21-23].)
\bttq Why did the Pharisees and teachers of the Law/scribes complain to the disciples?
\tqe Jesus and his disciples were eating with the tax collectors and other people whom the Pharisees regarded as sinners. They were people who did not follow all the ways Pharisees said that were necessary to fully please God. (30)
\bttq What do you think is the meaning of Jesus's illustration about people who need a doctor?
\tqe Sick people know they need help, so they do whatever the doctor tells them to do to get well again. In the same way, people who know they are sinners, know they need someone to help them become right in God's sight again.
\tqe Jesus said that he came to help the people who [know they] sin to repent. The people who already think they are well or righteous do not look for, and do not want, any help. (31-32)
\bttq Jesus used the picture language of people who know they are sick and people who think they are well. To whom, do you think, was he referring?
\tqe The tax collectors, disciples and those whom the Pharisees called sinners knew that they needed Jesus to help them.
\tqe Generally, the Pharisees and teachers of the Law/scribes were the ones who thought that they were good/righteous. Therefore, they thought that they did not need Jesus to forgive them.

\rf Luke 5:33-39 Some people asked Jesus about the reason that his disciples did not fast.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 5.33-39
\bttq Jesus's disciples treated fasting and praying differently than John's disciples and the followers of the Pharisees did. How did Jesus show the reason for that difference?
\tqe He told them stories to explain/illustrate the reason. (34-35, 36, 37-39)
\bttq What did Jesus show in his picture language was the reason for this difference?
\an (Note: The more parts of the answer which someone gives, the better the answer, but even one part will be an acceptable answer. Not every part must be understood from this one reading.)
\tqe Jesus was saying that his disciples were celebrating something new, that is, the son of God was among them. This meant having new ways of responding to God and his Word.
\tqe The old ways were no longer adequate, [even though they had been right and good in their time and had served well].
\tqe These new ways, however, would not just blend in and match the old, but must totally replace them.
\bttq What did Jesus imply that the response of some people would be to him?
\bttq -OR-
\bttq How did Jesus expect some people to respond to him?
\tqe They would reject the new ways [of relating to God which he, Jesus, lived and taught,] and stay with their old ways [as explained by the Pharisees and teachers of the Law]. (39)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 5.33-35
\bttq How were Jesus's disciples different from the disciples of John and the Pharisees?
\tqe The disciples of John and of the Pharisees often fasted and prayed. Jesus's disciples did not. (33)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "fasting" discussed at 2:37.
\bttq What comparisons did Jesus make when he used the picture language about a wedding?
\tqe He compared his disciples to the friends of the bridegroom and compared himself to the bridegroom. (34-35)
\bttq In what way, do you think, did Jesus's comparison answer their question about why his disciples did not fast?
\tqe Jesus's disciples did not fast at that time because they were happy that Jesus was with them (34). Later, when he had been taken away from them [by his enemies], they would fast [because they would be sad] (35).
\tqref LUK 5.36
\bttq What did Jesus say was the reason that it is not good to patch/mend an old piece of clothing with a piece cut from a new piece of clothing?
\tqe The new one is ruined and the old one looks strange and mismatched.
\bttq What comparison, do you think, was Jesus making when he used the picture language/parable about the new clothing and the old clothing and a patch?
\tqe The new clothing represented what Jesus was teaching about a person's relationship with God.
\tqe The old clothing represented the ways the religious teachers had taught the people to relate to God in the past.
\tqe The patch was only a small piece of the new way. It did not really make things better.
\bttq What do you think were ways that Jesus wanted the people to change?
\tqe If the people wanted to be in a right relationship with God, they must follow what Jesus taught, and not just try to improve what they were already trying to do.
\bttq If the people who speak your language use picture language/parables, tell me one of those stories and then tell me its meaning.
\tqe Key Term Check: A parable shows its meaning indirectly by using picture language to make a comparison. The parts of the comparison are generally not explained. The listeners themselves must think much about the meaning hidden in each part of the picture language. Jesus taught spiritual truths in this story form. (See "parable" in KBT.)
\tqref LUK 5.37-39
\bttq What did Jesus say was the reason that it is not good to put new wine into old wineskins?
\tqe New wine will [ferment and swell and] burst the old wineskin [which is no longer flexible] and will spill out onto the ground. That will ruin both the wine and the wineskin. Neither one will have any value. (37)
\bttq What comparison, do you think, was Jesus making when he used the picture language about the new wine and the old wineskin?
\tqe The new wine represented Jesus's new teaching [about a person's relationship with God].
\tqe The old wineskin represented the way the people had been relating to God in the past.
\tqe If people tried to fit the new ways into the old patterns [as taught by the Pharisees and traditions], that would not work. The old way, then, was no longer useful and the value of the new way would be lost, too.
\bttq What do you think were ways that Jesus wanted the people to change?
\tqe (He wanted them to change in the same ways as he had talked about in the parable with the old and the new clothes.) If the people wanted to be in a right relationship with God, they must follow what Jesus taught, and not just try to improve what they were already trying to do, such as fasting.

\rf Luke 6:1-11 Jesus's authority was greater than the laws about the Sabbath Day.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 6.1-11
\bttq Why did the Pharisees criticize Jesus and his disciples for picking grain?
\tqe They thought that Jesus and his disciples were disobeying the Laws [of Moses] about [not working on] the Sabbath Day. (2, 7)
\bttq What did Jesus tell them about the Sabbath Day?
\tqe He said that he, the Son of Man, was Lord over it, that is, he had authority [from God] to say what could be done on the Sabbath Day. (5)
\tqe Also, he implied [with the example from God's Word about David and his companions] that God permitted people to do good, helpful things on the Sabbath Day when there was a special need. (3-4, 9)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 6.1-5
\bttq Where was Jesus walking one Sabbath Day?
\tqe He was going through grain fields. (1)
\bttq What kind of a place do you think a grain field is?
\tqe It is a field/garden where grass crops like wheat or barley are planted to raise the seeds for food.
\bttq What did Jesus's disciples do as they walked there?
\tqe They picked some heads of the grain, rubbed them around in their hands [to remove the husks] and ate the kernels. (1)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that they did that?
\tqe They were probably hungry. (3-4)
\an (Note: They were not stealing the grain. The Law of Moses allowed them to take some grain to eat as they walked along [Deut. 23:25].)
\bttq What do you think that the Pharisees were thinking about when they criticized Jesus and his disciples?
\tqe They regarded what the disciples did as being work, [like harvesting grain or gathering food]. People were not permitted by the Law [of Moses] to do any kind of work activity on the Sabbath Day. (2)
\bttq What did David and his companions once do when they were hungry and had no food?
\tqe They entered [the grounds of] the house of God,
\tqe received [from a priest] the bread which only the priests were permitted to eat [after they had offered a new set of fresh bread to God],
\tqe and ate it [even though they were not priests]. (4)
\bttq Why was that food/bread special and only for the priests to eat?
\tqe The priests previously had given it to God, setting it out [on a special table] for him. (4)
\bttq Does it sound to you as though Jesus was saying that David and his men had done something wrong?
\tqe (It should not sound that way. Rather, Jesus was using this story about David as an example that it is more important to meet a need than to obey the rules of religion.)
\bttq Who was this "Son of Man" whom Jesus said had authority to decide what was permitted on the Sabbath Day?
\tqe Jesus himself was the Son of Man. (See 5:24.)
\tqref LUK 6.6-8
\bttq What was wrong with one man in the synagogue where Jesus was teaching?
\tqe He had a shriveled/atrophied right hand. (6)
\bttq Why were the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law/scribes carefully watching Jesus?
\tqe If Jesus healed that man on the Sabbath Day, they would have a good reason to accuse him of working. The Law [of Moses] did not permit anyone to work on the Sabbath Day. (7) (Then they could punish him or, at least, tell people that he was not a good teacher of God's Word.)
\bttq Why did Jesus tell the man with the shriveled hand to stand up in front of everyone else?
\tqe He knew what those men were thinking, so he wanted everyone to clearly see him heal the man. (8)
\tqref LUK 6.9-11
\bttq The Pharisees did not answer Jesus's question about which choice should be made. Which of those choices do you think that people should choose?
\tqe People should choose to do good, which may save someone's life. (9)
\bttq How did the man's hand become perfect again?
\tqe Jesus told him to stretch it out straight. When the man obeyed Jesus, his bad hand became completely well. (10)
\bttq How did the Pharisees respond when Jesus told them these things and then he healed the man?
\tqe They were furiously mad/full of anger at him and began discussing what they could do to [kill] him. (11)
\an (Note: See Matt. 12:14 and Mark 3:6, where the Pharisees stated clearly what they intended to do.)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law were so angry at Jesus?
\tqe He neither interpreted the rules, nor obeyed them in the way that they had taught people to obey them.  -OR-
\tqe He implied that, if people followed their rules, they might do something evil or even destroy someone's life. (9)  -OR-
\tqe He was making them appear to be foolish in front of many people.

\rf Luke 6:12-16 Jesus chose twelve men and appointed them as his apostles.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 6.12-16
\bttq Why did Jesus spend a whole night praying to God?
\tqe A large group of disciples followed Jesus. He wanted [God to help him] to carefully choose a few men out of that large group to become his apostles. (12-13)
\dh Details
\bttq Do you think that Jesus went alone to pray or that other men went with him?
\tqe He probably went alone. Luke wrote that Jesus went into the hills to pray and that he wanted to choose some special workers. (He probably would not have asked any other person to join him at that time.) (12)
\bttq How do you know God had helped him choose the right men?
\tqe He immediately chose them in front of the other people who followed him. (13)
\bttq How many men did he choose for this special work?
\tqe Twelve men. (13)
\bttq What was the special name Jesus gave this group of twelve men?
\tqe He designated them as his apostles. // He named them apostles. (13)
\bttq What do you think the difference was between the work an apostle would do and the work a disciple would do?
\tqe Key Term Check: An apostle was sent with full authority from the one who had sent him to speak or act in his place. A disciple was really only a student who followed his teacher around. He had no authority to represent the teacher. (See "apostle" and "disciple" in KBT.)
\bttq Tell me about the two men named Simon.
\tqe Jesus gave the name Peter to one Simon. He was the brother of Andrew. (14)
\tqe The other Simon was known as the Zealot. (15)
\bttq What do you think a "Zealot" was?
\tqe Jews who really wanted their people and their country to be free from the control and rules of the Roman government were called Zealots. They felt strongly that they should be independent.
\an (Note: If the word is not already translated by a descriptive phrase, the translator may want to explain the word in a footnote or glossary item.)
\bttq Tell me about the two men named James.
\tqe One was a son of Zebedee and the brother of John (see 5:10). They were partners with Simon in the fishing business. (14)
\tqe The other James was the son of a man named Alphaeus. (15)
\bttq Tell me about the two men named Judas.
\tqe One was the son of a man named James. (15)
\tqe The other Judas was Judas Iscariot, who [later] became a traitor [to Jesus]/a betrayer [of Jesus]. (16)
\bttq What do you think it means for a person to be a traitor/betrayer?
\tqe Key Term Check: He acts like a good friend to you or your group, but then he helps your enemies do something bad to hurt you/your group.

\rf Luke 6:17-26 Jesus explained what kind of people are truly happy.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 6.17-26
\bttq What will happen to those who want to know God better and want to please him?
\tqe They will be happy/feel blessed [by God]. They will receive a great reward in heaven. (20-23)
\bttq What will happen to those who want to have the things which are part of this world and want to please themselves?
\tqe They will be punished [by God]. They have already received whatever happiness they will ever have. (24-26)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 6.17-19
\bttq Who was waiting for Jesus when he came down the mountain?
\tqe There was a large crowd of disciples/followers
\tqe and a great many other people from all over the area where Jews lived, [including] Jerusalem,
\tqe as well as people from the region beside the sea where the towns of Tyre and Sidon were. (17)
\bttq Why were those people waiting for Jesus?
\tqe They had come to hear him [teach God's Word]
\tqe and to have him heal them of their diseases. (18)
\bttq What happened to some of those people?
\tqe Those people who were troubled by evil spirits were healed. (18)
\tqe Those people who touched Jesus were all healed by his power (flowing out from him,) [into them]. (19)
\tqref LUK 6.20-23
\bttq What are some of the characteristics of those whom Jesus says are happy/feel blessed by God?
\tqe They are poor (20), hungry, weeping (21) and hated (that is, excluded, insulted and defamed) by others because they associate with Jesus (22). (That is, they focus on God.)
\an (Note: The Greek word which is translated in these verses as "blessed" is not the same word which Luke used back in 1:42, 1:64, and 2:28 when Elizabeth, Zechariah, and Simeon each blessed someone. The word Luke used here refers to inner happiness, not outward happiness.)
\bttq Why would the disciples know they should expect this kind of trouble/bad treatment?
\tqe The [peoples'] forefathers had treated the prophets, [who also had focused their lives on God,] the same way. (23)
\bttq Why are the people who have these troubles called happy/blessed by God?
\tqe God rules and reigns in their lives, that is, they live under God's authority and direction. (20)
\tqe Their hunger/needs/desires [to know God better and to please him] will be met. (21a)
\tqe Their crying will become laughter. (21b)
\tqe They will receive a great reward [from God] in heaven because [people will treat them] the same way as the [peoples'] forefathers treated the prophets [whom God had sent out with his message]. (23)
\tqref LUK 6.24-26
\bttq What are some of the characteristics of those people who should expect God to cause horrible things to happen to them?
\tqe They are rich (24), well fed, enjoying this present life (25) and ones about whom people say good things (26).
\bttq Why will they suffer punishment from God, and not blessings?
\tqe They have focused their lives on becoming rich and have already enjoyed many pleasures in this life. (24)
\tqe They have focused their lives on eating well, but will still hunger/have a need [for real satisfaction]. That hunger will not be met. (25a)
\tqe They have focused their lives on entertaining themselves, [not on what pleased God]. (25b)
\tqe They have focused their lives on being praised by everyone else, [but not by God]. (26)
\bttq What do you think happened to the false prophets and the [peoples'] forefathers who always praised them?
\tqe God punished them.

\rf Luke 6:27-36 People who follow Jesus's teaching should love their enemies.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 6.27-36
\bttq Why should people who want to follow what Jesus taught do/be good to everyone?
\tqe Because their Father [in heaven] is compassionate towards them, they should be compassionate in the same way to all others, including their enemies. (31, 35-36)
\tqe Also, they should do/be good to them because God will greatly reward them and call them his children. (35)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 6.27-31
\bttq To whom was Jesus telling these words?
\tqe He was speaking to those people who heard what he taught them [and desired to obey him]. (27) (Those people were referred to as his disciples in verse 20.)
\bttq How should a person who follows Jesus treat his enemies?
\tqe He should love his enemies. (27)
\an (Note: The person who answers may also talk about doing good to them (27), blessing them and praying for them (28). If he included all these, you should skip the next question. If he did not include these things, please ask the next question.)
\tqe Key Term Check: The Greek language has several words which are translated "love" in English. The word used here means a gracious, outgoing, active interest in the welfare of another person. John used the same word to explain how much God loves us [John 3:16; 1 John 4:9-11. Jesus used the word to talk about loving God and loving one's neighbor as one loves himself [Mark 12:30-31]. Paul used the word to tell how a husband should act toward his wife [Eph. 5:25]. We should love our enemies the same as God loves us and the same as we love anyone else, including our wives and God. The translator must have good reasons if he/she has used a different word for love in this verse than he/she would use in those other contexts. See "love" in KBT.)
\bttq How should one show love for his enemies?
\tqe Do good to those who hate you (27),
\tqe ask God to bless those who curse you (28a)
\tqe and pray for those who are cruel to you (28b).
\an If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn [so he can hit] the other one also. (29a)
\an If someone takes something of yours, such as your coat, do not stop him from taking [other things, such as] your shirt. (29b)
\an If someone asks you to give him something, give it and don't ask for it back. (30)
\bttq What do you think that a person will say or do if he is cursing you? (28)
\tqe Key Term Check: He wants evil and suffering to come into your life, so he asks spirit beings, either God or an evil spirit, to cause you injury or trouble. This is the exact opposite of the meaning of "blessing". (See "curse" in KBT in the "bless, blessed, blessing" entry.)
\bttq What did Jesus say is a good way to remember how we are to show love to such people?
\tqe We should do for other people what we want them to do for us. (31)
\tqref LUK 6.32-34
\bttq Why did Jesus not praise people who show love or do good only to those who have already done the same for them?
\tqe Even people who do not try to obey God, do that. (32-33)
\bttq What if you lend something to another person knowing that he will repay you?
\tqe That, too, is not any different from what any non-Christian would do. You will not receive any special credit from God for doing that. (34)
\tqref LUK 6.35-36
\bttq Jesus said that we are to love our enemies, do good to them (27) and lend things to them without expecting to get anything back (30). If we do like that, what will be the result?
\tqe [God] will greatly reward us
\tqe and [people will know that] we are children of the Most High [God]. (35)
\bttq Why will we be regarded as his children for doing like that?
\tqe We will be doing as our heavenly Father, God, does. He is kind and compassionate, even to the people who are ungrateful and wicked. (35-36)

\rf Luke 6:37-42 People should not judge others.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 6.37-42
\bttq What did Jesus say about people who judge the actions and motives of others?
\tqe He said that they are like blind people trying to show other blind people the right way (39).
\tqe They are hypocrites because they have the same problems in even greater amounts, but do not pay attention to them (42). (They are no help to anyone.)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 6.37-38
\bttq What does it mean to judge someone?
\tqe Key Term Check: A person sees or hears something about that other person, evaluates it, and decides how he will act towards that other person. Usually the person who judges assumes a position of authority [and superiority] over the one he is judging. (See "judge, judgment" in KBT.)
\bttq In what ways can one show God's mercy to another person?
\tqe Jesus said that we are not to judge the other person['s motives] or condemn him/her, that is, we are not to decide what is an appropriate punishment for that person. We should forgive that person (37) and be generous to them (38). That will show God's mercy.
\bttq If we do not judge others, but forgive them, how will God act toward us?
\tqe He will not judge or condemn us, but will forgive us (37). He will be generous to us (to the same degree that we have been generous to others). He will give us even more, in return, than we might have expected (38).
\bttq What did Jesus say that tells you that God will be generous to us?
\tqe He spoke about a good/full measure, about pressing the things down [in the container], about shaking the things together and about extra things spilling over [the edge of the container]. (38)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the person selling the grain (6:38) would pour it into the buyer's lap/onto the buyer's clothing?
\tqe The seller did that in order that the buyer could carry the grain away. (Also, the grain would be too much to carry in cupped hands.)
\an (Note: In the Jewish culture of Jesus's time the people wore loose-fitting clothing. Some folds of extra cloth were spread wide at times to be used to carry such things as grain. See TN for Luke 6:38.)
\tqref LUK 6.39-40
\bttq What did Jesus say will happen if a blind man follows another blind man?
\tqe Neither man will see a hole, so they both will fall into it. (39)
\bttq What other picture language did Jesus use to show us how we are to know what to do?
\tqe He talked about a student learning all that he is able to learn from his teacher. Then he would be like his teacher. (40)
\bttq To whom, do you think, was Jesus referring when he talked about a blind man? (39)
\tqe The blind man represents any one who does not know what is the right thing to do. If we follow such a person, we will be just like them. That is, we will not know what is right and will probably get hurt, besides.
\an (Note: Jesus may have been referring to Jewish leaders who did not accept that God had sent him to be the savior. Whoever followed their leading would also not believe in him.)
\bttq To what teacher and students, do you think, might Jesus have been referring? (40)
\tqe He was referring to himself as the good teacher. People who do what he teaches are his students, his disciples. Those people will be like him.
\bttq First look at what Jesus taught his disciples in verses 20-40. Then tell me four or more ways which Jesus said that his disciples could be like him. (NOTE: All of these items should be clear in the translation, but do not expect anyone to find more than six quickly. Four items will be adequate.)
\tqe The disciple/student will want to know God better. (21a)
\tqe He will be hated, insulted, and rejected [by people who oppose God]. (22)
\tqe He will love his enemies [as well as his friends]. (27a, 35)
\tqe He will do good to those who hate him. (27b, 35)
\tqe He will bless those who curse him. (28a)
\tqe He will pray for those who treat him badly. (28b)
\tqe He will be generous and lend, even to those who are ungrateful. (30, 34, 35, 38)
\tqe He will act toward others the same as he would want them to act toward him. (31)
\tqe He will be kind to those who are ungrateful or wicked. (35)
\tqe He will be merciful [to those having needs]. (36)
\tqe He will not judge or condemn others. (37a)
\tqe He will forgive others. (37b)
\tqref LUK 6.41-42
\bttq What did Jesus say in his picture language about a speck of sawdust and an entire plank?
\tqe A person with a plank in his own eye sees a speck of sawdust/wheat chaff in another person's eye and offers help, not even noticing his own bigger problem. (41)
\tqe Key Term Check: Jesus said that the man with the small thing in his eye was the other man's "brother". If the translation uses the kin term for brother, ask about whom one calls his "brother" in that culture. If that word refers only to people who are one's blood relatives, suggest using a term with a wider meaning. The Greek word for "brother" included a wider sense of referring to other men with whom one interacted regularly, such as one's neighbor. See "the brothers" in KBT in the "disciple" entry.
\bttq What do you think that Jesus wanted us to learn from this picture language?
\tqe We do not notice, or try to correct, our own big problems or very bad actions. Instead, we are quick to see other people's small problems and wrong actions and tell them what to do, as though we are better than they are.
\bttq What did Jesus call a person who acts like that?
\tqe He called that person a hypocrite. (42)
\bttq What might a village person have done that would cause other people to call him/her a hypocrite?
\tqe Key Term Check: Such a person pretends to believe or do what other people will approve or for which they would praise him. He does not act because he really believes it is right or good.
\bttq What did Jesus say one must do before he is able to help another person with his problem?
\tqe He must get rid of his own big problem before he can help another person with his/her small problem. (42)

\rf Luke 6:43-45 Jesus told a parable about recognizing a tree by its fruit.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 6.43-45
\bttq How did Jesus compare trees and their fruit to people?
\tqe We can know the true inner character of a person by his/her words and actions (45), just as we can tell the quality of a tree by looking at its fruit (43-44). // In the same way that fruit can only be as good as the tree which produces it (43-44), a person's words and actions will reflect what is in his/her heart (45).
\dh Details
\bttq What did Jesus say about trees and their fruit in this parable?
\tqe He said that good trees produce good fruit and bad trees have bad fruit. Therefore, one can know whether a tree is good or bad just by looking at its fruit. (43-44)
\tqe Also, the specific kind of fruit depends on the kind of tree on which it is growing. (44)
\bttq What did he say about people and their character and behavior/actions?
\tqe He said that good people have good qualities in their hearts and those are seen in their behavior. Evil people have evil thoughts in their hearts and those are seen in their evil behavior. A person's words show the kind of thoughts which are in his/her heart. (45)

\rf Luke 6:46-49 Jesus told a parable about the way in which two men built houses.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 6.46-49
\bttq How did Jesus use the example of the base/foundation for a house to show us how people ought to respond to Jesus's teaching?
\tqe Those who set their way of living [and their faith] on a good, firm basis which will last, do so when they not only hear the words of Jesus, but also obey them.
\dh Details
\bttq Why was Jesus upset by people calling him by the respectful title "Lord"?
\tqe They talked as though they respected him as their teacher, but they did not show it by obeying what he taught. (46)
\bttq Who did Jesus say is like a man who builds his house on a firm/strong base/foundation?
\tqe He is the person who comes to Jesus, hears his teaching, and then does what Jesus said. (47)
\bttq What happens when troubles come to a person who has that strong base/foundation for his life?
\tqe He stands firm [in his faith]. // He is not moved [from his strong belief in Jesus]. (48)
\bttq Who did Jesus say is like a man who does not build his house on a firm/strong base/foundation?
\tqe He is the person who hears Jesus's teaching, but does not do what he said. (49)
\bttq What happens when troubles come to such a house or such a person?
\tqe The house does not stand firm. It collapses and is totally destroyed. [Likewise, the troubles destroy a person who does not base his life on Jesus. He will suffer in hell forever].(49)

\bttq What did Jesus do to help a Roman army officer?
\tqe He healed his servant/slave who was sick and dying [without going directly to the man]. (6, 10)
\bttq Why did the Jewish elders want Jesus to help the Roman army officer?
\tqe They said that the officer loved their Jewish people
\tqe and that he even had helped much to build a synagogue for them. (4-5)
\bttq What was the real reason that Jesus helped the army officer, even though he was not a Jew?
\tqe Jesus knew that the officer had great faith in him [to heal his servant]. (9)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 7.1-6
\bttq What happened that caused a Roman army officer to send a message to Jesus?
\tqe The servant/slave of the army officer was sick and about to die (2), and the officer heard about Jesus [either that he healed the sick, or that he had returned to Capernaum] (3).
\tqe Key Term Check: See 1:38 above for the meaning of "servant" and "slave".
\bttq Why was this important man in the army even thinking about a servant/slave?
\tqe He loved/respected/valued this young man. (2)
\bttq Whom did this army officer send with his message to Jesus?
\tqe He sent some elders of the Jews. (3)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the Roman army officer sent those men and not other Romans or himself?
\tqe Perhaps he thought that Jesus would listen to elders of his own Jewish people more than to someone who was not a Jew.
\bttq What message did this army officer send to Jesus?
\tqe He wanted Jesus to come and heal his servant. (3)
\bttq How do you know that those Jewish leaders also wanted Jesus to help this Roman man?
\tqe The words "kept on urging"/"earnestly asked"/"strongly requested" mean that those Jewish leaders wanted Jesus to help the man. They said that he was worthy [in their thinking] to have Jesus help him. (4)
\tqref LUK 7.6-8
\bttq Whom did this army officer send with another message to Jesus?
\tqe He sent some of his friends. (6b)
\bttq Why did the army officer himself not want to inconvenience/cause any problem for Jesus?
\tqe He did not feel worthy/good enough to either speak with Jesus or to have Jesus come inside his home. (6b-7)
\an (Note: He also may not have wanted to cause a cultural problem for Jesus, because he knew that it was taboo for a Jew to enter the house of a non-Jew.)
\bttq How did the army officer expect Jesus to heal the servant/slave if Jesus did not go inside the house where that sick man was?
\tqe He believed that Jesus needed only to speak [the words of healing from wherever he was] and the sick man would be well again. (7)
\bttq How did the army officer know that Jesus could heal his servant just by saying that the man was to become well?
\tqe He knew how authority worked. // He was under some higher authority and others were under his authority. When someone with authority spoke, that command was carried out. (8)
\an (Note: By saying this, he showed that he believed that Jesus had been given authority by God over sickness. When Jesus spoke, the sickness would have to end/leave.)
\tqref LUK 7.9-10
\bttq How did Jesus react to the words of the Roman army officer?
\tqe He was amazed and told the crowd of people that he had not found [any other person with] great faith like that, not even among the people of Israel. (9) (He knew that this kind of strong faith did not normally happen even among the Jews who had God's Word and who had Jesus himself in their midst.)
\bttq What does it mean that someone believes/has faith in another person?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that he believes what that person told him and that he trusts that person to do just as he said that he would do. (See "faith" in KBT in the "believe" entry. Also see 5:22, above.)
\bttq How do we know that Jesus healed the army officer's servant/slave?

\tqe His disciples and a large crowd of other people were with him. (11)
\bttq What did they all see happening as they came near the gate/entranceway in the town wall? (12)
\tqe Men were carrying out a dead person [on a stretcher], and many townspeople were with them.
\an (Note: If the language requires that the manner of carrying a dead person be named, use the appropriate cultural name for such a stretcher or platform. The translation must not imply that the men carried the corpse in their bare hands, even if it was wrapped in cloth. That was taboo for a Jew.)
\bttq Where do you think that the men were taking the corpse? (12)
\tqe They were going to bury it away from where the people lived.
\bttq Who was the dead person?
\tqe He was the only son of a widow. (12)
\bttq What do you think made this especially sad for the woman?
\tqe Being a widow, she needed a son to care for/support her.
\tqe Also, a son was needed to carry on the family lineage and name.

\bttq What do you think it means in 7:15 that "Jesus gave him back to his mother"?
\tqe Jesus put him back under his mother's care.
\an (Note: The young man owed his life to Jesus. In wanting to show his never-ending thankfulness to Jesus, the young man might have followed the cultural practice of being like a slave to the one who had saved him. Jesus released the young man from that sense of debt and "gave him back to his mother.")
\an -OR-

\an (Note: If the translation refers to God "visiting" his people, ask what that means when someone who speaks that language does that action in the village. If the primary meaning is to stay with someone you have not seen for a while, suggest a change in terms. The original Greek word had much more focus on coming to care for or look after someone else. The word strongly implies that the visitor takes a continuous responsibility for the one/ones being visited.)

\tqe Now Jesus was ministering to needy people [just as the prophet Isaiah had said that the one sent from God would do], adding to, and finishing, [in unexpected ways] what John had started (21-23).
\bttq How did people respond to what Jesus said about himself and John? His answer appeared to be different from what John and others had expected.
\tqe Some people [had repented and] had John baptize them. They were the same ones who now were recognizing that God was working through Jesus [and were ready to obey him]. (29) (They believed that God was doing through Jesus's ministry what they had expected through John's ministry.)
\tqe The Pharisees and the experts in the Law [of Moses] had rejected what John had told them, so they were not ready/able to accept what Jesus now taught them, either. (30)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 7.18-23
\bttq John [the Baptizer] learned about Jesus's ministry through his own disciples and had not gone to see for himself. What do you think was the reason for that?
\tqe King Herod had put John in prison earlier (see 3:20), so he could not go see for himself.
\bttq What was the important question that John wanted to ask Jesus?
\tqe Was Jesus the person whom God had said would come [as the Messiah], or were they to wait for someone else [to be the Messiah]? (19, 20)
\bttq What had John's disciples seen and heard that should be a clear answer to him?
\tqe They had seen Jesus heal many who were sick or had evil spirits in them. (21)
\tqe He also had made the people who were blind to see (21, 22);
\tqe [he had made] those who were lame to walk (22);
\tqe [he had] healed those who had leprosy/bad skin disease, making [them] ritually clean; (22)
\an (Note: The meaning of the Greek verb katharizw includes both physical cleanness and ritual cleanness. [See L&N entry 23.137.] A different word is used in verse 21 to refer only to being healed. The translation may need to use two verbs to cover all the meaning here.) (See the discussion at 5:12-16 about leprosy and people being made clean.)
\tqe [he had made] those who were deaf to hear [22];
\tqe [he had] raised those who were dead [ to be alive again] [22]; 
\tqe and he was telling/preaching the Good News to the poor people (22). (The Good News was that God had sent the Messiah to save them and that God wanted to rule and reign in their hearts.)
\bttq In what way, do you think, were all these things a clear answer to John's question?
\tqe They all showed that Jesus was God who had come among the people to help them (as people had been saying all over the country [17] ).
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They all showed that Jesus had power from God [just as Jesus had read in the Nazareth synagogue from the prophet Isaiah's writings (See Luke 4:17-21) ].
\bttq What kind of person did Jesus say would be truly happy when he thought about all the things that Jesus was doing?
\tqe That person is one who does not stop believing that Jesus was the Messiah whom God had sent into the world. (23)
\an (Note: Although verse 23 is worded as a general truth and applies to everyone, Jesus was specifically directing this statement to John, just the same as verse 22. If the person answering these questions has not heard or read much about John's ministry in his/her own language, he will probably not realize that John expected the Messiah to do things differently from the way Jesus was doing them. John expected that Jesus would talk more of God's judgment, as John had done, not of God's love. That is the reason that John sent his disciples to ask the important question in verse 19.)
\tqref LUK 7.24-28
\bttq Why had people gone into the uninhabited area/wilderness/desert to see John?
\tqe They went because he was a prophet, even more than an ordinary prophet. (24-26)
\an (Note: There had not been any prophet from God for over 400 years, so many people went to see John out of curiosity, as well.)
\bttq In what ways was John not like a reed in the wind? (24)
\tqe Reeds are very ordinary plants like stiff grass, which people commonly see as the wind blows them back and forth.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Wind blows and pushes reeds back and forth in various directions, but John always was strong to preach the same message about repenting. He did not change his message because someone, such as King Herod, did not like to hear it (see 3:19-20).
\bttq In what ways was John not like a man in fine clothes? (25)
\tqe People who wear expensive clothes live in large, beautiful, expensive homes, such as a king does. John lived in the desert (see 1:80b).
\an (Note: We also know that John wore clothes made from rough camel hair and ate things which he found in the wilderness/desert [Mark 1:6].)
\bttq What was the purpose of John's ministry?
\tqe God had sent him as a messenger. John was to tell people to prepare their hearts/thoughts [to accept Jesus as the one whom God had sent to save them]. (27)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus said that John was greater than anyone else ever born? (28)
\tqe He had the important work of preparing the way for Jesus, the savior of all mankind.
\bttq What do you think is a way in which whoever is least important in the kingdom of God is greater than John? (28)
\tqe John, the greatest one to announce that the kingdom of God had began, was not as great as the least important person who experiences the joy and blessings of Jesus having saved him and who now obeys God as he rules and reigns in that kingdom.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe John regarded himself as a very unworthy servant (see 3:16), but every one who believes that Jesus has saved him/her is a child of God. That is greater than being a servant.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe John was in the prison and did not live to see Jesus die for mankind's sins and be raised by God to live again. The least important person who knows that those things did take place and believes that is greater (that is, blessed more) than John.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe John understood the kingdom of God as focusing on God's final, great judgment of all the world and on the circumstances which surrounded the Jews. Jesus knew that the kingdom was something inside a person, something spiritual and eternal. The least important person who understands that as Jesus did is, therefore, greater than John.
\tqref LUK 7.29-35
\an (Note: The Greek text does not tell us whom the people had been "hearing". The translators of most English Bibles today, including NIV, GNB, and RSV, understand that Luke was writing about people who heard Jesus teach about God [7:29-30]. If the vernacular translation follows this understanding, use only the first form of the question below.
\an However, the translators of the GW translation understand these two verses to be part of the words of Jesus, referring to people who heard John the Baptizer preach. If the vernacular translation follows this understanding, use only the second form of the question. The answer is still the same for either question.)
\bttq How did the people, including those who collected taxes, respond when they heard Jesus speak about John like this?
\bttq -OR-
\bttq How did the people, including those who collected taxes, respond when they heard John preach?
\tqe Since John had baptized them, they all acknowledged that God's plan was right. [Part of that plan had been that John had helped them to prepare their hearts for the ministry and teaching of Jesus.] (29)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They all agreed that God was just [in his judging their sins and in his claim on their lives], as they had previously shown by their having had John baptize them. (29)
\bttq How did the Pharisees and the experts in the Law of Moses respond when they heard Jesus speak of John like this/when they heard John speak like this?
\tqe They rejected/refused to accept God's purposes/plans for themselves [in Jesus's message], as they had already shown by refusing to have John baptize them. (30)
\bttq Whom did Jesus compare to little children?
\tqe The people alive at that time [who had seen and heard both John and Jesus]. (31)
\bttq In what ways had those people acted like little children?
\tqe They did not like it when someone was serious and did not join in their lighthearted fun,
\tqe Neither did they like it when someone was joyous, but they felt he should be more serious. (32)
\bttq To whom did Jesus refer as the one who had been serious, but the people had rejected him?
\tqe He referred to John the Baptizer. (33)
\bttq What did some people see John do that they did not like?
\tqe They did not like him because he did not eat [food] and drink [wine] as they did. (33)
\bttq What do you think those people meant when they said that John had a demon [in him]? (33)
\tqe The way John lived (his clothes, food, home and appearance) caused people to think a demon was living in him and telling him things. (That was not true, but if it was true, the people would be right to not obey John's message, even though he said that it was from God).
\bttq To whom did Jesus refer as the one who had been joyous, but the people had rejected him also?
\tqe He referred to the Son of Man, (that is, he referred to himself). (34)
\bttq What did some people see Jesus do that they did not like?
\tqe They did not like him because he ate and drank with tax collectors and others whom they regarded as sinners [that is, people whom they thought were socially and religiously unacceptable]. (34)
\bttq How could anyone know whether John's and Jesus's ministries were really part of God's wise plan or not?
\tqe Those people who obeyed what John and Jesus taught were the ones who lived according to God's will/wise plan for them, [not those people who rejected both John and Jesus]. (35)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The lives of those who followed the teaching of John and Jesus showed that this was the right/correct way to be in the will of God. (35)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe People prove that God's will/wise plan is right when they live according to what John and Jesus taught, and God accepts them, [while he does not accept those people who reject what John and Jesus taught]. (35)

\rf Luke 7:36-50 A sinful woman anointed Jesus with perfume.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 7.36-50
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus allowed this woman, whom other people regarded as bad, to touch him and put perfume on him?
\tqe Jesus allowed her to do what she did in order to teach Simon that God forgives anyone who repents.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe She responded with great love for Jesus because she realized that she had sinned much and God had forgiven her. (The more people realize that they have sinned, the happier they are when God forgives them.) (47)
\bttq What did Jesus say was the reason that he had forgiven this woman?
\tqe She believed/had faith [in Jesus as the one who saved her from sin]. (50)
\an (Note: If the person answers that she loved Jesus/God very much, so he forgave her, that is the wrong answer. The translator has misunderstood the meaning of verse 47. Adjust that verse when you discuss it below [7:44-47], then read the adjusted section of the translation and ask this Overview question again.)
\dh Details 
\tqref LUK 7.36-39
\bttq What did Luke write about the woman who came to the Pharisee's house?
\tqe She was [regarded by the other people as] a sinner, that is, a person who had done many things which were obviously against the Law of Moses. (37)
\bttq Why did she come to the Pharisee's house?
\tqe She knew that Jesus was there to eat with the Pharisee. (36-37)
\bttq Knowing that, what did she do?
\tqe She brought a stone bottle of perfume. (37)
\tqe She stood weeping near Jesus's feet [which were stretched out behind him, as he reclined] (38),
\tqe wetting his feet with her tears (38).
\tqe Then she wiped his feet with her [long] hair (38),
\tqe repeatedly kissed them (38),
\tqe and then poured the perfume on them (38).
\tqe Key Term Check: The Greek word which is translated "poured on" in verses 38 of the NIV is translated "anointed" twice in verse 46. It is the same Greek word that Luke used in 4:18, but here the focus is on the literal pouring, not the figurative use for appointing. See "anoint" in KBT.
\bttq In verses 38 and 45 we heard the words "she kissed his feet". What, do you think, was the woman actually doing?
\tqe Key Term Check: She touched or pressed her pursed lips on his feet as a sign of her affection and reverence/respect for him.
\an (Note: If the culture of the translation does not show affection or reverence with the kissing action, it is more important to keep that purpose clear, rather than worry about describing the exact action of the woman. In verse 45, Jesus referred to the kissing action as a sign of greeting, though not done to the feet. It would be best if one action could stand for both, as in Jesus's time, but that may not be possible.)
\bttq What did the Pharisee think about this woman?
\tqe He thought of her as a person who had sinned much [and everyone knew it]. (39)
\bttq What did the Pharisee think about Jesus because he did not forbid the woman to do this?
\tqe He thought that Jesus was not a prophet because he allowed a sinful person to do this for him. (The Pharisee expected that a true prophet would have knowledge from God about the woman's bad actions in the past.) (39)
\tqref LUK 7.40-43
\bttq What did Jesus do to help the Pharisee Simon understand the meaning of the woman's actions?
\tqe He told a parable about two men who owed another person money. (41-42)
\bttq Tell me the parable.
\tqe Two men owed money to another person. One owed much more than the other. However, neither man could repay that money, so the moneylender forgave each man his debt. (41-42)
\bttq Which man did Simon say would love the moneylender more than the other man did?
\tqe He said that it probably was the one who had the bigger debt canceled. (43)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that would be true?
\tqe The one who had been forgiven much would show it more than the person who had been forgiven less.
\tqref LUK 7.44-47
\bttq If Simon had been a good Jewish host, he would have done certain things when Jesus arrived. What things did Jesus say that Simon had not done for him?
\tqe Simon had not given any water to Jesus for [washing] his feet. (44)
\tqe He had not given Jesus a kiss [of traditional greeting]. (45)
\tqe He had not anointed Jesus's head with [olive] oil [to show hospitality]. (46)
\bttq Which person showed the greater love for Jesus, Simon or the woman?
\tqe Jesus indicated that the woman did.
\bttq On what basis could anyone know that the woman's many sins had already been forgiven by Jesus?
\tqe They could see that she loved [Jesus] very much, [as such a person might do]. (47)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus meant when he implied that Simon had been forgiven few sins?
\tqe Simon may have thought that he did not sin much, so he had not ask God to forgive him much. (Simon had not realized how much God had forgiven him, so his response of love was less than the woman's response.)
\tqref LUK 7.48-50
\bttq What did Jesus tell the woman about her sins?
\tqe They all had been forgiven [by him]. (48)
\bttq What was the reason that Jesus had forgiven her many sins?
\tqe She believed/had faith [that Jesus could save her and cause her to have a right relationship with God]. (50)
\bttq What do you think this peace is that Jesus said would be in/with the woman as she left him?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is peace which God gives to a person who has trusted Him/who has believed in His Son. This peace is a calm heart/spirit free from worry when we face God because he has already forgiven our sins. (See "peace" in KBT.)
\bttq When Jesus told the woman that her sins had been forgiven, what did the other people there think?
\tqe They knew that only God could forgive sins, so they thought that Jesus was taking the place of God [and should be punished (see 5:21) ]. (49)

\bttq Who traveled with him?
\tqe His twelve apostles/disciples traveled with him. (1)
\tqe Also with him were some women from whom Jesus had made evil spirits leave or whom he had healed of other diseases. (2)
\bttq How did Jesus and his disciples have enough money for the things they needed?

\rf Luke 8:4-15 Jesus told a parable about a man sowing seed in his field.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 8.4-15
\bttq What did Jesus teach the people by means of this story about seeds and different types of ground?
\tqe Different people believe God's message [about the savior] in differing amounts. Some do not want to believe it, others only believe a little bit, and others are ready to believe everything God has said. Only those people whose hearts are ready [to receive and obey Jesus's teaching] will experience the fruit/benefits/good things that will come from believing. (12-15)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 8.4-8
\bttq Tell me what happened to the seeds in the story Jesus told.
\tqe Some seeds fell on the path. [People and animals] walked on them and then birds ate them. (5)
\tqe Some seeds fell on rock. It came up, but withered because there was not enough water. (6)
\tqe Some seeds fell where thorns grew. The thorns grew [big] and choked the plants. (7)
\tqe Some seeds fell on good ground and produced very much/a hundred times as much new seed. (8)
\bttq How did the man plant that seed?
\tqe He scattered the seed over the top of the ground. (5)
\an (Note: If the people who will use this translation do not plant seed in this way, a footnote may be helpful to explain that scattering seed is appropriate in many cultures. The man was not being foolish when he scattered the seed.)
\bttq When Jesus finished telling the story he said that the people with ears should listen. Every person has ears. What do you think that he meant? (8)
\tqe He meant that everyone should pay attention [and think carefully about the hidden meaning]. 
\tqref LUK 8.9-10
\bttq Why did the disciples ask Jesus to explain the parable?
\tqe They did not understand the meaning of the picture language. (9)
\bttq What did Jesus say was hidden in this parable?
\tqe The secrets about the kingdom of God, that is, how God planned to save people and then rule and reign as the one who is most important in their lives. (10)
\bttq To whom would Jesus explain the meaning of the parable, and to whom would he not explain it?
\tqe He would explain it to the disciples, but not to the other people. (10)
\an (Note: The Greek word order shows that Jesus emphasized the contrast between the two groups of people. The pronoun which refers to the disciples was put first in its part of the sentence and the pronoun which refers to the other people was put first in the second part of the sentence. It says, "To you [God] has given ..., but to the rest [it is] in parables." If the translator is able to show a strong contrast between the two groups in the wording of his translation, it would be good to do that here.)
\bttq Why were Jesus's disciples able to understand the meaning after he explained it, but the other people did not understand?
\tqe Because the disciples believed that Jesus was God and they were following him and learning more about God, he caused/allowed them to understand. (10)
\bttq Other people also saw Jesus do miracles and heard him tell the good news from God. What do you think was the reason that they not understand what they saw and heard? 
\tqe They did not believe that God had sent Jesus to be their savior. Therefore, God did not allow them to understand. They would not have followed God better, even if they had understood the meaning.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus quoted what the prophet Isaiah had written. He implied that the same situation was happening again. The Jews living at the time of Jesus did not want to pay attention to God's message just like their forefathers in the time of Isaiah had not paid attention to Isaiah's message from God. (Jesus also implied that the end result for those who did not believe that God had sent him would be the same as it had been for their unbelieving forefathers. Their cities would be destroyed and their people would be scattered. [See Isa. 6:9-12.])
\tqref LUK 8.11-15
\bttq What did the seed in the parable represent?
\tqe It was the Word of God/God's message [about saving us by means of Jesus]. (11)
\bttq What did Jesus say that the different types of ground represented?
\tqe They were the people who heard/listened/paid attention [to God's message].
\tqe -AND/OR-
\tqe They are the people who hear/listen/pay attention [to God's message]. (12-15)
\bttq What happened to the different listeners?
\tqe Some heard God's message, but the people did not pay attention. Then the devil took what they had heard away, that is, he made them forget all about it. (12)
\tqe Some heard it, received it excitedly and believed it for a while. But when troubles came to them, they stopped believing it. (13)
\tqe Some heard it, but the good things of this world became more important to them than God's message and took over its place in their lives. They thought about the things in this world more and more and they thought about God less and less. Before very long, other people could tell by their words and actions that they did not believe in God any more. (14)
\tqe Some who were honest and good heard it and kept it in their hearts and minds. Even through troubles, they continued to believe it. Finally, other people saw many good things that pleased God in their lives. (15)

\rf Luke 8:16-18 Jesus used a lamp to explain that he would not hide the truth about the kingdom of God.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 8.16-18
\bttq What do you think that Jesus wanted to teach the people by means of this story about a lamp and its light?
\tqe The purpose of a lamp is to help people by making light for them to see clearly. Jesus was like the lamp that God had put on earth to make the truths about the kingdom of God clear to those who listened carefully.
\dh Details
\bttq Why do people light lamps?
\tqe People light lamps to give light when they cannot see otherwise. (16)
\bttq What does a person do with a lamp after he lights it?
\tqe He puts/places it out where it can be useful, as on a lamp holder. He does not hide it under anything. (16)
\bttq When the lamp is lit, what will happen to things that a person could not see in the dark?
\tqe The person (and others who are nearby) will see them clearly. They will not be hidden any more. (17)
\bttq Why should a person listen well to what Jesus taught us about the kingdom of God?
\tqe The person who understands/believes [even a small amount] will receive [help from God] to understand/believe more. (18)
\bttq What will happen to a person who does not have any understanding/faith?
\tqe [God] will even take away what little understanding/faith he thought that he had. (18)

\dh Details
\bttq Who came to see Jesus?
\tqe His mother and brothers came to see him. (19)
\bttq Why did someone need to tell Jesus about them?
\tqe The crowd of people was so large that they could not get near Jesus. (19)
\bttq Whom did Jesus say he regarded the same as his mother and brothers?
\tqe Those [people] who hear God's word and do [what it says] are as important to him as his blood relatives.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe  Those [people] who hear God's word and do [what it says] are more important to him than if they were his blood relatives. (21)

\tqref LUK 8.22-25
\bttq Tell me what happened to Jesus and his disciples in their boat.
\tqe (The answer should cover the basic outline of the story, including Jesus rebuking the storm and the lake as well as rebuking his disciples. Any part which the person does not mention can be reviewed by using a specific question from below.)
\bttq What can we learn about Jesus from what Luke wrote about the men in the boat?
\tqe Jesus showed that he had authority over all [the forces] of nature, [such as the wind/storm/waves].
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 8.22-24
\bttq Where were Jesus and his disciples going in a boat?
\tqe They were going to the other side of the lake. (22)
\bttq What did Jesus do while they sailed their boat on that lake?
\tqe He fell asleep. (23)
\bttq What happened while Jesus slept?
\tqe A terrible windstorm blew down [from the surrounding mountains] onto the lake. (23)
\tqe The boat began to fill [with water] and the men were in danger [of drowning/dying]. (23)
\bttq What did the disciples do and say to Jesus?
\tqe They woke Jesus and told him they were about to be destroyed [by the storm]. (24a)
\bttq What did the disciples think would be the final outcome of this storm?
\tqe They thought that they would violently die [by drowning]. (23-24a)
\tqe Key Term Check: The Greek word that describes what the disciples thought would happen to them focuses on the destruction and total ruin of people or objects. It is the same word that  was used in 5:37 to describe what happened to the wineskins. See "destroy, perish, (be lost" in KBT.)
\tqref LUK 8.24-25
\bttq After the disciples woke Jesus, what did he do?
\tqe He sternly commanded/rebuked the wind and the violent, tossing waves (and the storm stopped, and all was calm again). (24)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus asked/talked about the disciples' faith?
\tqe They had acted just as though they did not believe that he had God's power to do whatever he wanted to do. // They had seen Jesus do great things by God's power, but they did not trust him to save himself and them now. // Their reaction to the storm was the same as the reaction of people who had no faith in God. (25) (See "faith" in KBT in the "believe" entry.)
\bttq Why were the disciples amazed at what had happened?
\tqe They had seen Jesus use [God's/his] authority over the winds and the water, and they did what he told them to do. (25) (They knew that ordinary people did not have any control over the natural elements.)
\bttq The storm had ended. Why were the disciples still afraid?
\tqe They realized that they were in the presence of one who had supernatural power to command even the winds and the water to obey him. He was not an ordinary person, as they were. (25)

\rf Luke 8:26-39 Jesus made many demons/evil spirits leave a man.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 8.26-39
\bttq Jesus cast many demons out of one particular man. What can we learn about Jesus from that?
\tqe Jesus showed that he had authority over all the fierce demons, [even those outside of Jewish territory].
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus wanted to help all people, even those who were not Jews and who did not live among the Jews.
\an (Note: These people had the same response to Jesus doing a miracle among them as his disciples had on the lake a short time earlier. Both groups were afraid of Jesus's great power being present among them. These Gerasene/Gadarene/Gergesene people rejected Jesus, but the man who was healed, and the disciples earlier, believed that God had sent Jesus.)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 8.26-29
\bttq Where is the area where Jesus [and his disciples] went ashore?
\tqe It is on the other side of the lake across from Galilee [province], in the land of the Gerasene/Gadarene/Gergesene [people]. (26)
\an (Note: You may want to note in a reference to a map or in a footnote that Jesus was now outside the area the Jews regarded as their own land. The people to whom he talked there were not Jews and they did not worship the true God.)
\bttq Whom did Jesus meet when he went ashore?
\tqe He met a demon-possessed man from the [nearby] town. (27)
\bttq What did Luke tell us about this man?
\tqe The man was from the town [of Gerasa nearby]. (27)
\tqe He had not worn clothes for a long time. (27)
\tqe He did not live in a house, but stayed among the tombs. (27)
\tqe When he saw Jesus [coming], he cried out, (28)
\tqe dropped to the ground, lying flat in front of Jesus [as a sign that he submitted himself to Jesus] (28)
\tqe and shouted out in a loud voice. (28)
\tqe Many times the demons had seized/controlled the man. (29)
\tqe  [People] tried to restrain the man by tying his hands and feet with chains (29)
\tqe and then guarded him, (29)
\tqe but many times the man had broken the chains (29)
\tqe and the demon had driven him into a region with no inhabitants/into the wilderness. (29)
\bttq What did the man shout in the loud voice to Jesus?
\tqe He shouted, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I plead with/appeal to you, do not torture me!" (28)
\an (Note: The question is a rhetorical one. The man was not asking Jesus for an answer. He was implying that, because Jesus was so different from himself in a spiritual sense, Jesus should leave the man and the spirits in him alone.]
\bttq Why did the man say this?
\tqe Jesus had already commanded the evil spirit/demon to come out of the man. (29)
\an (Note: It is also implied that the demon was saying that he and Jesus had nothing in common, so he did not want anything to do with Jesus, who might punish him.)
\bttq How was it, do you think, that the man already knew Jesus's name and that he was the son of God?
\tqe Demons know who God is, and who God's son is, [because God has authority over them].

\tqe They did not want him to command them to go to the Abyss, the deep hole with no bottom. (31)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "abyss" in KBT in the "hell, Hades, abyss" entry. It is the place where God imprisoned evil spirits and they suffer torment ever since he expelled them from heaven.

\tqe He was dressed and he was thinking clearly. (35)
\bttq How did they feel after seeing the man act so differently than before?

\bttq What do you think was the reason that they were afraid?
\tqe They were afraid because they knew it meant that Jesus had great power to drive out those demons from the man.
\bttq How did those people learn about what had happened to the man who had demons in him?
\tqe The people who had seen [Jesus] heal him told them. (36)

\bttq When the man was asking to go with Jesus, where do you think Jesus was?
\tqe Jesus was still there in the man's country, walking to the boat or even getting into the boat.
\an (Note: The last word of 8:37 in the Greek is "he-returned", and in the NIV, "... and left." But what happened in 8:38-39a took place before Jesus actually left the man.

\tqe touched the edge of his outer clothing (44),
\tqe and was healed (44).
\bttq What was the woman's sickness?
\tqe For twelve years she had suffered from excessive [menstrual] bleeding. (43)
\bttq (See the Note first.)  What had the woman done to try to be healed? 
\tqe  She had paid all her [money] to doctors [to help her], but no one had been able to heal her/stop the bleeding. (43)
\an (Note: Many Bible scholars do not believe that Luke wrote the words that we find in some manuscripts about paying doctors. Therefore, the translator may not have included it in this translation, or it may be set apart by special use of punctuation. If those words are not in the translation, then skip this question.)

\tqe She had to tell her story in front of all those people. (47)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe She feared that Jesus would be upset with her or even take away her healing [because she had not asked, and then she had hesitated to speak when Jesus asked his question].

\bttq Jesus was not a father, but he called this woman by the title, "Daughter". What do you think that he meant by calling her "Daughter"?
\tqe Though she was not his real daughter, he wanted to show her that he cared about her and was not angry with her.
\an (Note: "Daughter" may not be the term used by the culture of the translation to show this same meaning. Use a culturally appropriate kin term or title for Jesus to address this woman. He wanted to show that he was friendly and caring as a father would be when helping his daughter.)

\bttq What were other people at Jairus's house doing?
\tqe They were wailing and mourning/showing their sorrow for the [dead] girl. (52)
\an (Note: One of the Greek words for what the people were doing describes their cultural practice of showing sorrow by beating on one's own chest. If the culture of the translation has words for both the crying about a person's death and for a cultural practice always associated with showing one's sadness, both of those terms should be used here.)
\bttq Why did Jesus tell those people to stop wailing?
\tqe He said that the child was not dead, but sleeping. (52)
\bttq Why did the people laugh at/make fun of Jesus?
\tqe They knew that the child was dead [so they assumed that Jesus was joking or did not know the truth]. (53)
\bttq What did Jesus do with the girl?
\tqe Holding her hand, he spoke loudly and told her to get up. (54)

\rf Luke 9:1-6 Jesus sent out the twelve apostles.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 9.1-6
\bttq What did Jesus send the twelve apostles to do on his behalf?
\tqe They were to preach/proclaim [that] God was restoring his kingdom [in the words and work of Jesus].
\tqe They were also to heal the sick. (2)
\an (Note: This "healing of the sick" probably included casting out demons from people who were bothered/controlled by them.)
\bttq How were the twelve apostles going to be able to do the great things that Jesus had been doing?
\tqe He gave them power and authority to drive/cast out all demons and to cure diseases. (1)
\bttq What did the apostles do when they went around to villages?
\tqe They announced the Good News and healed people everywhere. (6)
\an (Note: The NIV uses the words "preaching the gospel" in this verse. This translates the Greek word which means "tell good news". The translator should use the same wording here that he used in 3:18 and 4:18 to talk about this message. It was the same message which John and Jesus had preached. [See "gospel" in KBT.])
\dh Details
\bttq What were the apostles to take with them on their travels?
\tqe They were to take nothing; no walking stick, no bag, no money, no food and no extra clothes. (3)
\bttq Those are all things people take with them when they go on a long walk to another place, even today. In what way, do you think, would the disciples get the things they might need?
\tqe Jesus expected them to trust God to provide for their needs. (They really would have to begin allowing God to rule in their lives.)
\bttq Where were the disciples to stay when they visited a village?
\tqe They should stay the whole time they were at that village in the first house where they were welcomed. (4)
\bttq What were they to do if the town's people did not welcome them?
\tqe They were to leave that town. As they were leaving, they were to shake off the dust from their feet. (5)
\bttq What would that action do besides help clean their feet?
\tqe It would show the town's people that the apostles were separating themselves from them. (5)
\tqe It would show that the apostles didn't want even dust from that place to go with them [in the work Jesus had given them]. (5)
\tqe It would show that the one who had sent the apostles, Jesus/God, would be angry with those people because of their unbelief. (5)
\an (Note: This custom was practiced by the Jews when they left a non-Jewish/Gentile town because just being there would make the Jews ritually unclean. Then they could not worship at the temple. If the apostles did this in Jewish villages and towns, townspeople would know that they were being treated as people who rejected God.)

\bttq Why was King Herod confused about who Jesus was?
\tqe He had heard about all that had happened [regarding Jesus's preaching and miracles]. (7)
\tqe Some [people] were saying that Jesus might be John [the Baptizer] whom [God] had raised from the dead. (7)
\tqe But Herod had seen John's head after [he (Herod) had ordered someone] to cut it off/sever it from his body, so he did not know who Jesus really was. (9)
\dh Details
\bttq What were other people saying about who Jesus was?
\tqe Some said that he was [the prophet] Elijah who had reappeared, while still others said that [God] had raised from the dead one of the [other] prophets of long ago. (8)
\an (Note: Elijah had not died, but God had taken him straight up to heaven [2 Kings 2]. Be sure the translation does not say that Elijah had "come back to life again".)
\bttq What did King Herod want to do to end his confusion?
\tqe He tried to meet/see Jesus. (9)

\rf Luke 9:10-17 Jesus fed more than five thousand people.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 9.10-17
\bttq Often many people sit down together to eat at a banquet/feast. What did you hear in this story that would cause you to say that a miracle happened when those 5,000 people ate together with Jesus? 
\tqe Jesus had only five bread rolls and two fish, but he, being the son of God, caused them to multiply/increase into enough pieces to satisfy all those people (16). Even more, they still had twelve basketfuls left over [uneaten] (17). (The leftover food was more than they had at the beginning [13], before Jesus blessed the food [16].)

\bttq What did the apostles do when they returned from the work Jesus had sent them to do?
\tqe They reported to Jesus what they had done [in their time away from him]. (10)
\bttq Why did Jesus take the apostles to an area near the town of Bethsaida?
\tqe He wanted to go somewhere away from all the people and only be with these twelve men. (10)
\bttq What happened while they were at that place?
\tqe When people found out where Jesus was, they followed him [to that place]. (11)
\bttq How did Jesus treat the crowd that followed him there?
\tqe He welcomed them, spoke to them about the kingdom of God and healed those who needed to be healed. (11)
\tqref LUK 9.12-14
\bttq Why did the twelve apostles want Jesus to send the people away?
\tqe The people needed to go where others lived (in surrounding villages or on farms) in order to have a place to stay [for the night] and in order to find enough food to eat. This was necessary because they were in an uninhabited place and it was getting late in the day. (12)
\bttq Did Jesus send all those people away like his disciples suggested to him?
\tqe No, he did not.
\bttq What did he do?
\tqe He told his disciples to give food to the people. (13)
\bttq How much food did the disciples have altogether?
\tqe They had five bread rolls and two [smoked/cooked] fish. (13)
\an (Note: The "bread" of the Middle Eastern cultures is not the size or shape of the loaf of bread common among Westerners. The word used for "fish" either should imply small ones that one person could easily eat at one meal, or it should not imply anything about size. The same story in John 6:9 makes it clear they were small fish or only portions of fish that were ready to be eaten with the bread. [See L&N entry 5.16.])
\bttq How many people were there with the disciples?
\an 5,000 people were there, counting only the men. (14a)
\an (Note: There were probably much fewer women and children present than men because it was far from where people normally lived. Also remember that the Jews began calling a boy a man after he had been through the ritual at the temple at the age of 12 or 13, as Jesus had done. Each culture begins to use the term "man" after different events and different ages. The terms used here should cover all the males aged 13 and older. For example, the Hewa translation in Papua New Guinea used the words "5,000 married-men and mature-boys".)
\bttq Do you think that the disciples wanted to go somewhere to get enough food for all those people?
\tqe No, they did not. They said earlier that no one lived nearby. It was an impossible option. (Besides, they would need a lot of money and more than 12 men to carry enough food back to that place. See Mark 6:35-37.)
\tqref LUK 9.14-17
\bttq What did Jesus tell the disciples to do about this problem?
\tqe They were to have the people get ready to eat by siting/relaxing [on the ground] in groups of fifty. (14b)
\bttq What did Jesus do about food for all those people?
\tqe He took the five bread rolls and two fish, and (16)
\tqe while looking up towards heaven, he blessed the food, (16)
\tqe then broke it [into pieces] (16)
\tqe and gave [the pieces] to his disciples to distribute to the crowd. (16)
\bttq How do we know there was enough food for all those people?
\tqe Luke wrote that all the people ate enough to be satisfied, and
\tqe [the disciples] carried away twelve basketfuls of leftover food pieces. (17)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 9.18-20
\bttq What do you think that Peter's answer to Jesus showed about the disciples?
\tqe They now recognized/believed that he was the Christ, the one whom God had sent to save his people as he had promised. (20)
\dh Details
\bttq What was Jesus doing before he asked his disciples these questions?
\tqe He was praying alone/by himself. (18)
\bttq What were his questions about?
\tqe His questions were about what the crowds of people and the disciples were saying about Jesus. (18, 20)
\bttq What were other people saying about Jesus?
\tqe They said that he was John the Baptizer, or Elijah or one of the [other] prophets of long ago who had risen from the dead. (19)
\bttq Who did the disciples say that Jesus was?
\tqe Peter said that Jesus was God's Christ, (the person God had set apart for coming to this earth to save his people). (20) (See "Christ, Messiah" in KBT.)
\an (Note: The Greek word order shows us that Jesus was making a strong contrast between the crowd's thinking and the disciples' thinking. It would be good if the translation could show that contrast. In English, it might be like this: "And you? Who do you say that I am?")
\bttq Jesus strongly warned/sternly commanded his disciples not to tell anyone what they knew about him. What did they know?
\tqe They knew that he was the Christ/Messiah. (20)

\tqe People would make him suffer; they would reject him [and his claim to be the Christ] and kill him. (22)
\bttq How would God treat Jesus?
\tqe God would raise him back to life again (three days after that). (22)
\bttq How should a person act who truly wants to follow Jesus?
\tqe He must do as Jesus did, being committed each day to God, even when the things of this world look like they will make that person very happy or when people might make fun of him because he believes in Jesus as the savior. Each day that person must deny his human desire to take good care of himself by focusing on getting more and more possessions. Owning all the things in the world will not keep him from dying or being killed. He must do as Jesus did, even if it leads to suffering, rejection or being killed. That will lead him to the kind of life God wants him to have. (23-25)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 9.21-22
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus told the disciples not to tell anyone yet about this? (21)
\tqe He didn't want them to tell other people yet because the Jews had wrongly understood what kind of a savior the Messiah would be. He needed more time to teach more Jews the truth about the savior whom God had now sent.
\bttq Whom was Jesus talking about when he spoke about the Son of Man? (22)
\tqe He was talking about himself.
\an (Note: See comments at 5:24.)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen to him?
\tqe He must suffer many things/in many ways/much. (22)
\tqe The elders [of the Jews] and the chief priests and the teachers of the Law/scribes would reject him/his claim to be the Messiah. (22)
\tqe People would kill him. (22)
\tqe [God] would raise him [from the dead/to live again] on the third day [of his being dead]. (22)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus named those three specific groups of people who would reject him and what he had to say about himself?
\tqe Those three groups were the leaders who together decided what was right or wrong for the Jews to do or think. They would influence all the other people as to what they should think about Jesus or do to him.
\tqe Key Term Check:
\an  The elders [of the Jews] were the older and wiser Jewish men who met to discuss problems in their Jewish society and culture.
\an  The chief priests were the leaders among the priests at the temple in Jerusalem. They decided everything that had to do with worship of God and use of the temple grounds. (See "Chief Priest, High Priest" in KBT.)

\bttq What must one do if he wants to follow Jesus?
\tqe He should deny himself, (23)
\tqe take up his cross each day and (23)
\tqe follow Jesus. (23)
\bttq What do you think it means to deny oneself? (23)
\tqe It means that a person does not think only about himself and those things which make him happy. (Jesus wanted people to think about how to please God and be totally committed to him first.)
\bttq At the time Jesus lived, when a person carried a cross, what do you think it meant? (23)
\tqe It meant that person was on his way to die (by being nailed on crossed timbers until he could not breathe anymore).
\tqe Key Term Check: See "cross, crucify" in KBT.
\bttq What do you think it means for people today to take up/carry one's cross?
\tqe It means that a person must accept whatever suffering comes because he is one who follows Jesus. He must be willing to die in order to remain faithful to God, even die in a humiliating way like those who died on a cross.
\bttq How often must the person who follows Jesus put his focus on God, not himself? (23) 
\tqe He must do it every day. Every day he must be willing to suffer whatever happens to him because he has put God first in his life. (This is not an action that a person does once and then forgets about it.)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen to the person who wanted to save his own life?
\tqe He said that person would lose it. (24)
\bttq That sounds like a contradiction in the way that people understand life and death. What do you think that Jesus meant by that?
\tqe The person who does not do as Jesus just said in verse 23 will lose his chance to have the eternal life that Jesus promised elsewhere in the gospels.
\tqe He may also die physically just as Jesus said that he would in verse 22.
\an (Note: Luke had not written anything about eternal life up to this point in his gospel. Therefore, if the language assistant has not been a worshipping Christian for a long time, he will find that this question is impossible to answer. He has no background to fit it into, and the words are a paradox. Do not be critical of anyone's answer to this question.)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen when a person loses his life because he follows Jesus?
\tqe He said that person would save it. (24)
\bttq This, too, sounds like a contradiction in terms. What do you think that Jesus meant by saying that?
\tqe He was not talking about a person's physical life, so he must have been referring again to spiritual life that is eternal. The person who does as Jesus said in verse 23 will receive the eternal life that Jesus promised.
\bttq What did Jesus say about a person who gains control or becomes the owner of everything in the world?
\tqe He has gained nothing important if it means that he loses or gives up his own spirit [for all of eternity]. // He has given up the most important, eternal thing in order to have pleasure in this short life. The trade is not worth it, Jesus said. (25)
\bttq What will happen to the person who is ashamed when other people know he follows Jesus and obeys what he taught?
\tqe The Son of Man, Jesus, will be ashamed of him/her when he comes [back to this earth from heaven, not from the grave,] surrounded by his [own] glory and the glory of the Father and the holy angels. (26)
\tqe Key Term Check: See the discussion about "glory" at 2:9 and 2:14.
\bttq Who is this "Father" Jesus was talking about?
\tqe He is Jesus's father, God, who is also our spiritual father. (See 6:35-36.)
\bttq Luke has not written anything in the earlier parts of this book about Jesus going away and coming back. To what, do you think, was he referring?
\tqe Jesus told us elsewhere in the gospels that one day he will come back from heaven to judge all the people on the earth. (See Matt. 16:27; 25:31-47; Mark 13:32-37; Luke 21:8-28.)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen before some of the people who were standing there would die?
\tqe Some of them would see/experience/give their attention to the kingdom of God.
\an (Note: The Greek word translated "see" is used in many contexts, from ordinary seeing with one's eyes to meanings which include more and more mental understanding which becomes clearer. These would include meanings such as, "pay attention to", "take notice of" and "be concerned about". It also is used figuratively to mean "experience". [See John 3:36 and Heb. 11:5.] The exact meaning to which Jesus referred when using this word in this verse is not altogether clear. Some of the possibilities are listed below.)

\bttq What do you think that Jesus wanted to teach or show these disciples by having them see these things happen on the mountain?
\tqe God was confirming that everything Jesus had taught them just the week before, as Luke recorded it  in 9:22-27, really was true. They must listen to Jesus and know that the glory about which he had spoken would still come.
\tqe  
\tqe (He wanted these few disciples to have a brief look at the glory he had been talking about which would come in the kingdom of God. The glory would first be Jesus's and, later on, every believers'. The glory existed already, but God had not yet fully revealed it to all the people. Not even all the believers had experienced it  yet.
\tqe They also heard the voice of God telling them that they must listen to Jesus. This was another witness confirming what they had heard Jesus himself already say. He was the one the disciples must follow, regardless of what the religious leaders told them. God had said so directly to them. What Jesus had just taught them in verses 22-27 was that he had insisted on suffering as the way to glory. He also had called on them to give up their own physical lives to gain eternal life, even to bear their own suffering because of their faith in him and follow him through his suffering.)

\bttq Where did Jesus take Peter, James, and John?
\tqe He took them up onto a mountain. (28)
\bttq Why did they go there?
\tqe They went there to pray. (28)
\bttq What happened to Jesus while he prayed?
\tqe The way that his face looked changed and
\tqe his clothing became sparkling/dazzling/radiant white. (29)
\bttq What did Luke write about Moses and Elijah?
\tqe They appeared in their heavenly glory/brightness and talked with Jesus. (31)
\bttq What did they talk about with Jesus?
\tqe They talked with him about his leaving [this world] while he was at Jerusalem. (31)
\bttq What do you think they meant by saying that Jesus would be leaving this world?
\tqe They meant that the events that would happen to Jesus at Jerusalem, namely, his dying, rising again would lead to his ascending into heaven.
\bttq What were the disciples doing?
\tqe They were asleep/kept falling asleep. (They were not praying.) (32)
\bttq What did the disciples see when they were fully awake?
\tqe They saw [the brightness of] his glory and the two men standing with him. (32)
\bttq When Peter saw all that, what did he suggest to Jesus that they (the three disciples) should do?
\tqe He felt good about being there, so he wanted to build three shelters, one each for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. (33)
\bttq In what way, do you think, did Peter not know what he was really saying?
\tqe He did not think about the meaning or implications of his words. He seems to have wanted to do something to keep Moses and Elijah there for a longer time. Spirit beings from heaven did not need physical shelters for protection or comfort.
\tqref LUK 9.34-36
\bttq What happened while Peter was speaking?
\tqe A bright cloud appeared and it surrounded/covered/enveloped them all. (34)
\bttq How did the disciples feel about that?
\tqe They were afraid [of all that was happening to them so suddenly/mysteriously]. (34)
\bttq Whose voice was it which spoke in that cloud?
\tqe God's voice spoke.
\bttq How do you know it was God who spoke?
\tqe He called Jesus his son whom he had chosen [to come into the world to die for mankind's sins]. (35)
\an (Note: The cloud and the brightness were also signs in the Old Testament that God was present. Any voice which people heard in that context was always God's voice. God had already spoken once from heaven when Jesus had been baptized by John [Luke 3:22].)
\bttq What did God say about Jesus?
\tqe He said that Jesus was God's son and God had chosen him [to be the Christ/Messiah/savior]. (35)
\bttq What did God say that the disciples should do?
\tqe They must listen to what Jesus taught them. (35)
\an (Note: The Greek wording emphasizes that Jesus is the one they must listen to and obey. When the religious leaders would later openly oppose Jesus concerning the writings of Moses and the prophets, the disciples knew that God had already told them directly whom they must obey.  When those same leaders would order the disciples to stop talking about Jesus,  the disciples could show from the Old Testament that they must follow God's instructions, not men's.)
\bttq What did the disciples see when the voice and the cloud had left?
\tqe Only Jesus was there [with them, not Moses and Elijah or God]. (36)
\bttq To whom did the disciples tell what they had seen and heard?
\tqe They told no one, but kept silent for the time being. (36)

\rf Luke 9:37-43a Jesus ordered an evil spirit to leave a boy, and it did.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 9.37-43a
\bttq What happened when Jesus and the three disciples came down from the mountain?
\tqe A crowd met them.
\tqe A man in that crowd had a son whom a spirit seized, caused him to have convulsions and would not leave him alone.
\tqe The boy also foamed at the mouth.
\tqe The other disciples had not been able to heal him, so the father pleaded with/appealed to Jesus to do it.
\tqe Jesus was upset with the disciples/all the crowd for not believing strongly that God could free this boy.
\tqe Jesus rebuked the demon, healed the boy, and gave him back into his father's care.
\tqe Everyone was amazed at the power of God.
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus was so upset?
\tqe He had given all twelve disciples power and authority over these things earlier (9:1). He had told them that the religious officials would reject his teachings and cause him to suffer and die because of it (9:22). They needed to believe completely in Jesus. However, they did not believe as completely as Peter had implied they did when he confessed his belief in who Jesus really was (9:20). Most of the other people also had followed Jesus regularly and heard what he had taught. He knew he was going to leave them all soon and did not have a lot of time to keep on teaching them. They should already have believed completely. This made him upset.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 9.37-40
\bttq One man in the crowd was shouting to Jesus. About what was he shouting?
\tqe He wanted Jesus to take a look at his son, (who was his only child [38]).
\tqe He begged Jesus to drive out the [evil] spirit that seized him (40), making the boy scream, have convulsions, and foam at the mouth. (It left the boy battered and bruised.) (39)
\bttq Had anyone else tried to help this man and his boy?
\tqe Yes, the other [nine] disciples had tried, but they had not been able to cast out the spirit. (40)
\bttq What does it mean to "cast out a spirit/demon" from a person?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means ordering the demon to immediately leave the person alone and go away.
\bttq How often had that spirit bothered the boy?
\tqe The spirit hardly ever left the boy alone. Because it attacked the boy so often, that [evil] spirit was destroying/killing the boy. (39)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The spirit had never left the boy easily. Whenever it had gone away, the boy was left badly injured from the wild thrashing of his body. (39)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the father was so worried that he now pleaded for help?
\tqe He loved his son very much. Also, he probably needed the son to carry on the family lineage and family name and to care for/support him when he became old.
\tqref LUK 9.41-43a
\bttq What kind of people did Jesus say these people were?
\tqe He said that they were unbelieving and morally wrong/crooked/wicked. (41)
\bttq How long did Jesus sound as though he wanted to stay and put up with their slow learning? (41)
\tqe He did not want to stay any extra time. He had told them everything that was important for them to believe and to live as members of God's kingdom. Jesus knew that his remaining time on earth was short. God would not delay his plan for Jesus to take away mankind's sin.
\bttq What did Jesus do about the boy?
\tqe He told the boy's father to bring his son to him (Jesus). (41)
\tqe He sternly commanded the demon [to leave the boy], (42)
\tqe healed the boy, (42)
\tqe and returned him to his father's care. (42)
\bttq What did all the crowd think about this?
\tqe They were all astounded/amazed at the great power of God to cast out such a powerful demon. (43a) (They knew that ordinary people did not have any control over the spirit world.)

\rf Luke 9:43b-45 Jesus says someone will betray him to his enemies.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 9.43-45
\bttq What new information did Jesus tell his disciples?
\tqe He told them that someone would betray [him,] the Son of Man, into the hands/control of other men. (44)
\bttq What do you think it means to betray someone into other people's hands/control?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means to deliver that person into the control of someone whom that person regards as an enemy. The person who betrays another pretends to be a friend or of the same mind as the person who is being betrayed, and then tricks him into making himself vulnerable/accessible to the enemy.
\bttq What were all the other people doing while Jesus talked to his disciples?
\tqe All the other people were [still] talking about being amazed at what Jesus had done. (43b)
\bttq How did the disciples respond to what Jesus told them?
\tqe Even though Jesus had told them to let the words really get set in their minds (that is, listen carefully and not forget), they did not understand what he meant. (45)
\bttq Why did they not understand?
\tqe The clear meaning had been hidden [by God]. As a result, they did not understand it yet. (45)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The clear meaning had been hidden [by God] in order that they not understand it yet. (45)
\an (Note: The Greek word hina relates parts of a sentence to each other. In this sentence it could be understood to either make the second part of the sentence be the result of the actions in the first part, or it could make the second part be the purpose of the actions in the first part. The choices above show these two acceptable ways to understand the verse.)
\bttq Why did they not ask Jesus to explain it more clearly?
\tqe They were afraid to ask him about it.
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the disciples were afraid to ask Jesus to explain his words?
\an (Note: There are several possible reasons that they were afraid to ask. Any one of these would be an adequate answer:)
\tqe  
\tqe They may have been afraid he would actually tell them about some terrible thing that was going to happen to him, that is, that he would be more specific about how he was going to die at the hand of others.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They thought that all he had said on this matter was too mysterious to want to know more about it.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus just had been angry with the people because they did not believe him. The disciples did not understand his teaching, so they did not want him to know that they did not understand this, either. He might really be angry with them then.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus just had shown everyone that he had God's power over evil spirits. It did not seem possible that anyone could trick/fool/betray Jesus into his enemies' hands/control. Therefore, they were afraid to ask about this.

\rf Luke 9:46-48 Jesus's disciples argued about who would be the greatest in the kingdom of God.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 9.46-48
\bttq Who did Jesus say would be the greatest/most important disciple?
\bttq -OR-
\bttq Who did Jesus say would be the greatest/most important person in the kingdom of God?
\tqe He said that the person who is willing to serve in the lowest position of honor is really the one who is the greatest/most important [in God's sight]. (48) (That person has given up all desire for personal greatness.)
\dh Details
\bttq What were the disciples arguing about among themselves?
\tqe They argued about which of them would be the greatest/most important person [in their group of 12/in the kingdom of God]. (46)
\bttq How did Jesus know about their discussion?
\tqe He knew because he was the son of God. No one told him about it. (47)
\bttq What did Jesus do with a small child?
\tqe He got a small child and had him stand beside Jesus. (47)
\tqe Then Jesus used that child as a focal point for what he told the disciples about being great/important. (48)
\bttq How did Jesus use this child to teach a lesson to the disciples?
\tqe When a person accepts/welcomes and cares for a child like that one in Jesus's name, it is the same as though that person is accepting/welcoming Jesus. And whoever welcomes Jesus is also welcoming/accepting [God] who sent him [into this world]. (48)
\tqe (A person whom God considers great/important is one who accepts the work of serving unimportant, ordinary people, as represented by this child. That person's attitude shows that he wants to serve Jesus, and God, who sent Jesus to this earth.)
\bttq What do you think it means to do something "in the name of Jesus"?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means doing something as Jesus's representative, in his place, or because we love him. It is doing something on the basis of who Jesus was and what he did, that he was holy and that he perfectly reflected God's love to all who would accept him. He did not do it for great honor, but because he loved God, he served him by doing what God wanted him to do among the people here on earth. (See "in the name of" in KBT in the "name" entry.)

\tqref LUK 9.49-50
\dh Details
\bttq Why did John and the other disciples try to stop a man from casting out demons in Jesus's name?
\tqe They tried to stop him because that man was not a member of their group (of Jesus's followers). (49) (John may have been thinking that Jesus had only given that power and authority to the twelve apostles [9:1].)
\bttq What do you think that it means here to do that work "in Jesus's name"? [Note: Only use this question if the translation does not make the meaning clear.]
\tqe The power and authority of Jesus are in his name. Calling on the name of Jesus and doing something in his name means that you are doing it with the power and authority of Jesus himself.
\bttq What did Jesus say that John and the other disciples should do about that man who was not one of the twelve apostles?
\tqe They should not stop him [from doing that work in Jesus's name]. (50)
\bttq What reason did Jesus give for his saying that?
\tqe The man was not working against Jesus, but for him, with the same goal Jesus had to free people from a demon's control. (50)

\rf Luke 9:51-56 People in a Samaritan village did not allow Jesus to stay in their village.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 9.51-56
\bttq How was Jesus's response to those people who opposed him different from his disciples' response to them?
\tqe James and John wanted to punish those Samaritans, but Jesus quietly accepted their being opposed to him and refused to retaliate against/pay back those who insulted him [and God]. (54-56)
\dh Details
\bttq For what event in his life was Jesus preparing?
\tqe He was preparing for the time when he would be going up [to heaven]. (51)
\bttq What did Jesus do as that time came closer?
\tqe He started to go determinedly towards Jerusalem. (51)
\an (Note: This statement by Luke marks a very important change in the way that he wanted us readers to look at the following events and teaching of Jesus. Each one is not just one more separate story, but each is part of how he was preparing himself and his disciples for what would happen to him in Jerusalem. Jesus knew these were his last opportunities to prepare his disciples.)
\bttq What were the messengers supposed to do for him?
\tqe They went ahead of him to a Samaritan village to get things ready for him [to eat there and stay overnight]. (52)
\bttq Who do you think that the Samaritans were?
\tqe They were the people who lived in the province of Samaria which lay between the Jews' provinces of Judea and Galilee.
\an (Note: Hundreds of years earlier, the king of Assyria had taken most of the Jews away as captives [see 2 Kings 17:24-41]. He had then sent people from other lands to live in that area. They married with the few Jews whom the king had left behind. The Samaritans were the descendants of those people. They had to be taught about God, but since the Assyrian king had destroyed the temple in Jerusalem, the Samaritans developed their own worship places and ways to worship. When the Jews returned from being captives, they rebuilt the temple in Jerusalem and stayed separate from the Samaritans, having nothing to do with them.)
\bttq What did the Samaritan people decide about Jesus and his disciples staying in their village?
\tqe They did not welcome/accept him, that is they refused to allow him to stay. (53)
\bttq Why did they refuse to have him stay there?
\tqe Because he was headed towards Jerusalem [to worship in the Jewish temple there]. (53)
\an (Note: Because Jesus was headed to Jerusalem to worship, it meant that he did not regard the Samaritans' temple on Mt. Gerazim nearby as a proper place in which to worship the true God. This offended the Samaritans.)
\bttq What did the disciples James and John want to do to the Samaritans?
\tqe They asked Jesus if he wanted them to call fire down from heaven to destroy those people. (54) 
\bttq How did Jesus respond to them?
\tqe He turned towards them and sternly rebuked them/commanded them [to stop thinking that way]. (55)
\bttq What did Jesus and the disciples do when they were not allowed to stay in that particular place?
\tqe They went on to another [Samaritan] village. (56)

\rf Luke 9:57-62 People who want to follow Jesus must let go of everything else they think is important.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 9.57-62
\bttq What do you think that Jesus would want us to learn from these examples about following him?
\tqe To follow Jesus means putting his desires for us as more important in our lives than our desires for our own well-being. We must come to him with no conditions, just as he followed his father's will in his own life. He had no desire for his own well-being, but his only desire was to do his father's will.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 9.57-58
\bttq Where were Jesus and his disciples going?
\tqe They were still headed towards Jerusalem. (9:51)
\bttq A man approached Jesus along the road. What did this man say to Jesus?
\tqe He said that he would follow Jesus wherever Jesus went. (57)
\bttq What do you think the man meant that he wanted to do?
\tqe He wanted to be a [close] disciple of Jesus and learn from him while traveling around.
\bttq What do foxes and birds have that Jesus said he did not have?
\tqe Foxes have their [own] dens/holes/homes in the ground and birds have their [own] nests [for rest, safety, and shelter], but he had no such place [of his own] where he could rest/sleep. (58)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus wanted that man to learn from his answer?
\tqe If the Son of Man, Jesus, had to live without the comfort of knowing he had his own safe home in which to rest, then his followers should not expect to have that, either. Knowing that other people [like those in the one Samaritan village] would not welcome him into their homes, then anyone who follows Jesus must expect the same thing to happen to him or her.
\tqref LUK 9.59-60
\bttq What was the response of another person to Jesus's call to follow him [and be his disciple]?
\tqe He wanted first to go [home] and care for his elderly father until the father [died and] was buried. (59)
\bttq Who did Jesus say should care for those who died?
\tqe Those who are [already] dead should care for the dead. (60)
\bttq That sounds impossible. What do you think that Jesus wanted the man to learn from that part of his answer?
\tqe Since dead people cannot do anything, Jesus must have meant that the people who have not repented from their sins (that is, those who are spiritually dead) and are not ruled by God (that is, those who are not in the kingdom of God), should care for those parents who need help and might die.
\bttq What did Jesus say was more important for that man to do than care for his father?
\tqe He must go and speak out about/proclaim the kingdom of God. (60)
\tqref LUK 9.61-62
\bttq What did another person want to do before following Jesus?
\tqe He wanted first to go back home and say good-bye to those who lived there/to his loved ones. (61)
\bttq What happens when a person wants to make straight lines for planting food (or, building a fence), but he/she regularly looks all around? (62)
\tqe He will have crooked rows for planting, so some plants will be too close together and other space will be useless.
\bttq What do you think is the way that this picture language of a man preparing his field/garden applies to serving in the kingdom of God?
\tqe The person who wants to be a disciple in the kingdom of God must keep his mind centered on God. In that way his work for God will be useful. Thinking about what he may have left behind, and longing for it, will slow him down and he will not be a useful worker (Luke 10:1-16).

\rf Luke 10:1-16 Jesus sent out 72 more disciples.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 10.1-16
\an  [Note: Some Greek manuscripts refer to only 70 disciples, but the editors of the United Bible Societies' The Greek New Testament, 4th revised edition, 1993, give a slight preference for the number "72" as the original number which Luke wrote here. You may have either number in the translation.]
\an  
\bttq What work did Jesus tell these 72 other disciples to do?
\tqe They were to go ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go (1) and decide which places would welcome him and which would not welcome him (based on how well they had been received) (8, 10, 16).
\tqe They were to speak a blessing of peace wherever they were welcomed (5-6, 8), and to shake off the dust from their feet wherever they were not welcomed [in order to show that God did not approve of what the people who lived at that place had done] (10-12).
\tqe They were to heal the sick in the places which welcomed them (9), and in every place tell the people that the kingdom of God had come (9, 11).
\tqe They were to ask God to send out more workers [to those people who were ready to hear the Good News]. (2)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 10.1-4
\bttq How were these many disciples to divide into groups when they went to do this work?
\tqe They were to go two by two. (1)
\bttq Where were they supposed to go?
\tqe They were to go to every town and place where he was planning  to go. (1)
\bttq Tell me about workers and fields which are ready to be harvested. (2)
\tqe Often when a very big harvest is ready to be gathered, there is a need for more workers than are available. The food or grain must be gathered quickly before it falls, rots, spoils, or is ruined by bad weather. The workday is usually long and the work hard.
\an  (Note: In many places, as in Israel, food/seed is planted in all the fields/gardens at the same time because of the times of rain and sun. Therefore, all the food and grain is ready to harvest at about the same time, too. If the culture of the translation has no understanding of this kind of seasonal planting and harvesting, probably a glossary item needs to be prepared for this text.)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus meant when he talked about workers and fields?
\tqe He was not talking about real fields with food or grain that was ready to be harvested. This was picture language about the many people who were ready to believe in him when those disciples would tell them about the kingdom of God being present/the Good News that Jesus had come to save them.
\bttq What did Jesus say about the number of workers compared to the number of people ready to hear and believe the good news about the kingdom of God?
\tqe The workers were few, but the number of people who were ready to hear was plentiful/very many. (2)
\bttq Who, do you think, was the Lord of the harvest, the owner of the field of ripe food/grain?
\tqe God was.
\bttq Do you think that there are now enough workers in the world, or are there still more people who need to hear about the kingdom of God?
\tqe There are still many more people today who have not heard about God's love, so many more workers are needed to go and tell them.
\bttq Tell me what kind of animals wolves and lambs are. (3)
\tqe Wolves are a variety of fierce, wild dogs which like to eat meat. Lambs are baby sheep which have a gentle nature and eat grass. They have no way to protect themselves from a fierce animal like a wolf.
\bttq What do you think that Jesus meant when he talked about lambs and wolves?
\tqe He was not talking about real animals. This is picture language about the disciples going out among people who would reject their message and might try to harm them. The disciples were not to be fierce, but gentle and harmless in their actions and words. (They were to depend on God to protect them.)
\bttq How were these disciples to get ready for going from place to place?
\tqe Jesus told them not to carry a money holder/purse/wallet, a bag [for extra things] or [extra] sandals/shoes. (4)
\bttq What were they to do if they met people as they walked from one place to another?
\tqe They were not to become involved in long conversations on the road, [but move on to do the work Jesus had sent them to do]. (4)
\tqref LUK 10.5-12
\bttq What were the disciples to do when they entered a house?
\tqe They were to bless [the people who lived in] that house with words of peace. (5)
\bttq What kind of peace do you think that was?
\tqe Key Term Check: This peace is a calm heart/spirit which is free from worry and quarreling because God's representative was in that house and brought Good News. (See "peace" in KBT.)
\bttq How, do you think, would a "man of peace" who lived in that house act towards Jesus's disciples? (6)
\tqe He probably would welcome them as the representatives of Jesus. He would be willing to listen to what the disciples said about the kingdom of God.
\bttq What will happen if the man of that house was not a man of peace?
\tqe The blessing of peace would not stay with that man, but it would return to the disciples [either to give them peace or to be as if they had never spoken it]. (6)
\bttq How were they to act when they stayed in someone's house?
\tqe They were to stay there during their whole time in that place, eating [and drinking] whatever the people gave them. (7)
\bttq What reason did Jesus give the disciples to make them feel comfortable about taking nothing along with them, and about staying in only one house and eating the food there?
\tqe He said that the worker was worthy to receive his pay. (7)
\bttq What were they to do in the places where they were welcomed?
\tqe They should eat what was given to them [by the people] (8),
\tqe heal the sick [people] who lived there,
\tqe and tell them, "The kingdom of God is near." (9)
\bttq What were they to do in the places where they were not welcomed?
\tqe They should go out into the streets [where many people would see them] (10)
\tqe and tell [the people there] why they were shaking the dust of that place off their feet [in protest] (11).
\tqe They should also tell those people that they should be fully aware that the kingdom of God was near [and they were not part of it yet]. (11)
\bttq What do you think was the purpose of telling those people once more that the kingdom of God was near?
\tqe The people would know that by rejecting the disciples and their message they were also rejecting their chance/the opportunity to become part of the kingdom of God. As the disciples left, so did the people's chance/opportunity.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The people would know that if they repented/changed their minds quickly, there was still one last chance while the disciples were in their town to tell them more, or they could arrange for Jesus to come and teach them.
\bttq With what did Jesus compare people who did not welcome the disciples whom he had sent?
\tqe He said that [the people of the town of] Sodom would bear/endure better the punishment God had for them on The Day [when he would judge all people] than [the people of] that town would be able to bear/endure the [even greater] punishment God had for them. (12)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He said that on The Day [when God would judge all people] [the people of] that town would have more/greater punishment [from God] than [the people of the town of] Sodom would suffer.
\an  
\an (Note: There is much implied information in this verse which Jesus, the disciples, and Luke all understood, but which the people who will read this translation may not know. Depending on the level of general Bible knowledge among the people, it may be necessary to have a glossary item which explains that the people who lived in the town of Sodom many years earlier had sinned greatly and God would severely punish them [Gen. 19]. The people of Sodom did not know God's plan to send a savior, so they did not trust God for being saved. By comparison, the people of a town which rejected the disciples and their message about the savior would be punished even more than the people of Sodom.)

\tqe Jesus referred to the day/time when God will judge all the people of the world, dead or alive. They will either live with him forever or be punished in Hell forever. (See Matt. 25:31-46.)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "judge, judgment" in KBT.
\bttq Why should the people from the towns of Korazin/Chorazin and Bethsaida expect God to severely punish them when he judges all people?
\tqe The people in those towns saw [Jesus do] miracles [besides teach them about the kingdom of God], but they did not believe him and repent. (13)
\bttq Jesus probably did the same things in those two towns that he had done in Capernaum and other cities of the Jews. What kinds of miracles do you think those people saw Jesus do? (Any two or three of these items will make an adequate answer.)
\tqe He cast demons out of people (4:33-36),
\tqe he cured any illness or disease (4:38-40), even leprosy (5:13),
\tqe he healed physical problems (5:17, 26 and 6:6, 10),
\tqe he raised dead people to be alive again (7:14-16),
\tqe he calmed a storm (8:23-25),
\tqe and he fed thousands of people with a very small amount of food (9:16-17).
\bttq What do you understand it is that makes something be called "a miracle"?
\tqe Key Term Check: A miracle is something which happens in our physical world that is different from the way that people know that the processes of nature take place. Spirit beings, such as God, use their great power to do these things. (See "miracle, sign, wonder, mighty work" in KBT. Also see the note in L&N, following entry 76.8.)
\an (Note: In the NT, all the miracles occurred so that the individual or the group of people who saw it happen would desire a stronger relationship with God.)
\bttq How did Jesus compare these two towns, Korazin/Chorazin and Bethsaida with other cities? (13)
\tqe If the people who lived in the [Gentile/non-Jewish] towns of Tyre and Sidon had seen those miracles, they would have sat in sackcloth and ashes to show that they had repented; but the people in these two Jewish towns had not repented. (13)
\tqe The people of Tyre and Sidon would bear/endure better [the punishment God had for them] when he would judge [all people on The Last Day] than these people would be able to bear/endure the [even greater] punishment God had for them. // When [God] judges [everyone on The Last Day], he will not punish the people of Tyre and Sidon as severely as he will punish the people of Korazin and Bethsaida. (14)
\bttq What do you think it would have meant if the people of Korazin and Bethsaida had sat in sackcloth and ashes? (13)
\tqe It was the cultural way to show great sorrow and mourning when a great tragedy had occurred.  In this case, they would have been showing great sorrow for their sins against God and their desire to obey him from then onward.
\an (Note: If this is not the custom for showing sorrow and repentance in the language area, it would be good to make the purpose clear in the text.)
\bttq What should people in the town of Capernaum expect to happen to them in the time when God will judge all people?
\tqe They should expect to be sent down to the place of the dead [where God would punish them]. They would not be taken up [by God/God's angels] to heaven where God lives. (15)
\tqe Key Term Check: If the language of the translation has a traditional name for the place of the dead, that name can be used. Here it refers to a place which is the opposite of heaven and all for which it stands. See "Hades" in KBT in the "hell, Hades, abyss" entry.
\bttq What do you think was the reason those people might have expected that God would take them to heaven?
\tqe Jesus had indicated that he had done miracles in Capernaum (4:23).
\tqe He had taught in the synagogue there and driven out the evil spirit from a man (4:31-44).
\tqe He had healed the Roman army officer's servant there (7:1-10).
\an (Note: We know from the other gospel writers that Jesus lived there [Matt. 4:13; John 2:12],
\an taught about the Kingdom of God there [Matt. 4:17; John 6:24, 59-64],
\an and healed the paralytic man there [Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:17-26].
\an The people of Capernaum may have thought that God would give them special treatment because Jesus had done all these things in their town, but they had not believed Jesus's message.)
\bttq To whom was Jesus talking in verse 16?
\tqe He was speaking to the 72 disciples he was sending out, not to the people of Capernaum.
\bttq What did Jesus say was the reason why the people who did not accept his disciples would receive great punishment?
\tqe The disciples were preaching the same message as Jesus, so when the people accepted them, it was the same as though they were receiving the one who sent them, Jesus.  When they rejected what the disciples' said, they were rejecting Jesus and his Father who had sent him. [By rejecting Jesus's disciples they were rejecting God's plan for them, so God would reject them. They could not be saved any other way.]  (16)

\rf Luke 10:17-24 The 72 disciples returned in joy and Jesus also rejoiced.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 10.17-24
\bttq What were the 72 disciples rejoicing about?
\tqe When they used Jesus's name, even the demons obeyed them [to leave people]./God had given them power even over demons. (17)
\bttq What was the real reason that they should rejoice?
\tqe It was that their names were recorded [by God] in heaven where he lives. (20)
\bttq About what was Jesus rejoicing?
\tqe God had chosen to give his wisdom and power to these un-schooled, unsophisticated, but obedient, men. (21)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 10.17-20
\bttq What did the 72 disciples say when they returned to Jesus?
\tqe They said that even the demons obeyed them [to leave people] when they (the disciples) used the authority of Jesus's name. (17)
\bttq What other work had they done besides casting out demons from people?
\tqe They had healed the sick and preached the Good News about the kingdom of God. (10:9)
\an (Note: The words of the disciples implied that the power over demons was more than what they had expected. Luke recorded only that Jesus had given them power over sickness and authority to preach. Jesus had not explained the full range of the authority he had given them until after they had returned [see vs. 19]. Their sensing that demons obeyed them was more than they had expected. That sensing of the disciples should be expressed appropriately in the translation.)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that it was important that the disciples used Jesus's name when they did that work?
\tqe The name of Jesus had/held all the power and authority that Jesus had given to them. They had no personal power or authority greater than the demons' power. The power and authority was only theirs because Jesus had given it to them. (Because Jesus was the son of God, the demons also had to obey what his representatives said that Jesus wanted them to do.)
\bttq How did Jesus respond to the disciples' excitement?
\tqe He said that he had seen Satan fall from heaven [where spirit beings live] just as a bolt of lightning flashes [instantly] from the sky to the earth. (18)
\bttq Who is Satan?
\tqe Key Term Check: He is a spirit being who is the chief enemy of God and of those who believe in God's Son, Jesus. (See "Satan" in KBT.)
\an (Note: It is more important to use a term which gives the right understanding of who Satan is, rather than imply that "Satan" is only a personal name.)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus meant by his response to the disciples?
\an (Note: Any answer that does not contradict what men wrote in the rest of the Bible is acceptable. The Greek words do not clearly indicate whether Jesus was referring to the time when the disciples had been casting out demons or to a time before the world began. The disciples had seen Satan's demons obey their commands in Jesus's name. Jesus told them that he had seen Satan himself have to leave heaven immediately at God's command.)
\tqe [In his spirit] he had seen Satan's control of people end each time the disciples [preached, healed, or] cast out a demon in Jesus's name. Satan truly was defeated.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Jesus had actually seen God cast Satan out of heaven before the world began, so the disciples' comments only confirmed that truth and were a sign of it.
\bttq What other examples did Jesus give to the disciples of how they might use the authority he had given to them?
\tqe They would be able to walk on snakes and scorpions (19)
\an and to overcome all the power of the enemy. (19)
\an Nothing would hurt them [when they were serving as Jesus's representatives]. (19)
\bttq Who do you think was the enemy to whom Jesus referred? (19)
\tqe Satan was that enemy.
\bttq What was a more important reason for the disciples to rejoice than that demons obeyed them?
\tqe It was more important that [God] had recorded their names in heaven. (20)
\an (Note: The Greek word that introduces verse 20 shows clearly that Jesus was going to say something different from what the disciples expected him to say. The translation should also show that change in the way that the speakers of that language usually show that.)
\bttq What do you think this picture language about writing names down means? (20)
\tqe It means that God knew that those disciples believed in Jesus as the savior he had sent. He knew that they were members in his kingdom and that he would allow them to enter heaven. They belonged there.
\tqref LUK 10.21-24
\bttq Who caused Jesus to be joyful?
\tqe The Holy Spirit did. (21)
\bttq For what did Jesus thank his father, God?
\tqe He thanked God that he (God) had hidden these things from those people who [thought that they] were wise and had learned much. He had done that in order that those people would not understand those things. (21)
\bttq What do you think those things were that God had hidden from the people who thought that they were wise and had learned much?
\tqe They were the things the disciples had learned about having authority as a follower of Jesus.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe It was the knowledge the disciples had that their names were recorded already by God in heaven.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe When they had seen God's power at work as they served Jesus, they knew that the kingdom of God had already come.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Satan truly was defeated and his workers had to obey Jesus's followers. God's plan for sending a savior had happened already.
\an (Note: The Greek text does not point back clearly to any one particular thing when it says, "these things".)
\bttq To whom, do you think, was Jesus referring when he said that little children had seen/understood things that God had hidden from others?
\tqe He was referring to his disciples who were ordinary, working people, not religious scholars. They were humble and willing to believe what he told them, not proud of their learning or stubborn.
\bttq What do you think it was that God had been pleased to do? (21)
\tqe He had hidden his plan from those who thought that they were wise and now had revealed it to those who were like little children in comparison [and they had believed it].
\bttq Listen to verse 22 again and then tell me to whom Jesus was speaking. Do you think that he was speaking at this point to his father or to all the people around him?
\tqe He was speaking then to those people who were around him, not to God.
\an (Note: The translation may need to make that change of hearer clear for the reader/listener.)
\bttq God had given some understanding, power and authority to those 72 disciples. What did Jesus say God had given to him?
\tqe All knowledge, power and authority had been given to him by [God] his father. (22)
\bttq Who did Jesus say will really know who God is and who his son is?
\tqe Only [God] the Father really knows who his son really is, 
\tqe and only [Jesus] the son and those [people] to whom he chooses to reveal him know who [God] the Father really is, that is, what his true nature is like. (22)
\bttq To whom, do you think, does Jesus choose to reveal more understanding about who God is and what he is like?
\tqe He chooses to reveal more understanding to all those who believe in Jesus as God's son who came into the world to save us as God had promised.
\bttq To whom was Jesus speaking in verse 23?
\tqe He was speaking only to his disciples.
\bttq Whom did Jesus say should feel happy/blessed by God?
\tqe [God] had blessed those [people] who had seen what those disciples had seen. (23)
\bttq What had the disciples seen?
\tqe They had seen Jesus, the Messiah, God's son, bring the Good News that they could be in the kingdom of God. They had also seen Jesus use his authority and power to help people. Now as Jesus's representatives to different places, they had been able to do the same as Jesus had done.
\bttq Who had wanted to see these things which the disciples had seen, and hear what they had heard, but had not been able to do so?
\tqe Many prophets and kings had wished that they could have seen and heard what the disciples experienced [while Jesus taught them]. (24)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that those prophets and kings had not seen or heard the things that the disciples had?
\tqe Those prophets and kings had died many, many years before Jesus was born on the earth.

\rf Luke 10:25-37 Jesus told a parable about a Samaritan man who showed mercy.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 10.25-37
\bttq How did what Jesus believed and taught about receiving the eternal life compare with what the Jewish expert in the Law understood about it from the Law of Moses?
\tqe Jesus told the man to do the very same thing that the man had said that Moses had written in the books of the Law. [He had to do what the Law said, not just know what it said.] (26-28)
\bttq How does a person get eternal life?
\tqe Jesus said that we are to love and obey God [perfectly], according to his commands that Moses wrote down. This included loving our neighbor perfectly, too. (26-27)
\an (Note: Every person who tries to do as Jesus said soon finds that he cannot do it all perfectly and will never get eternal life by his own efforts. The only way left is to trust in Jesus's perfect life and in his death so that God could forgive our sins. Thus, eternal life is a gift from God.)
\bttq What is the answer to the expert's second question, "Who is my neighbor?"
\tqe A person's neighbor is anyone/everyone who needs our help in any way. (36-37)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 10.25-29
\bttq What did the expert in the Law want to know about eternal life?
\tqe He wanted to know what he had to do so that he could receive/inherit that life. (25)
\bttq What kind of life do you think that eternal life is?
\tqe Key Term Check: Eternal life is a life that is not affected by time limits, such as whether a person is still alive physically or not. That kind of living can begin now while we are still alive and will go on forever, even after our bodies die. Jesus, in his dying and rising on our behalf, made it possible for us to have that eternal life. God graciously and freely allows us to have that new life. It is a life of having a close relationship with God, obeying him as he rules over us. (See "life" in KBT.)
\bttq Why was that expert in the Law asking that question?
\tqe He wanted to test Jesus, [whether he really knew about God's laws and how to interpret them or not. He may have hoped to make Jesus appear wrong in front of the other people]. (25)
\bttq What did Jesus ask the man to tell him?
\tqe He asked the man to tell him what [Moses] had written [about eternal life] in the Law. (26)
\bttq What had Moses said that people should do to receive eternal life?
\tqe A person should love God with every part of him and then love his neighbor as [much as, or in the same way as, he loves] himself. (27)
\tqe Key Term Check: The Greek word for "heart" referred to the physical organ in the chest which pumps blood around the body. The word also referred to the center of a person's feelings, desires, and emotions. This verse refers to the heart as the center of emotions. The translation should use the term for whatever body part the culture says is that center of emotions, not necessarily the word for the heart. See "heart" in KBT.
\tqe Key Term Check: See 1:46-48, above, for comments on "soul". Also see "soul" in KBT.
\bttq What did Jesus say about the expert's answer?
\tqe He had answered correctly. If he did that, he would have [eternal] life. (28)
\bttq Jesus had answered the expert's first question completely. Why did the expert in the Law ask Jesus another question about this topic?
\tqe He wanted to justify himself, that is, he wanted to show that he was doing the right thing by his wanting to clearly understand how to get eternal life. (29)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He wanted to show that he was right in the way that he had been living and treating people. (29)
\an (Note: He may have felt embarrassed in front of the other people because Jesus had him answer his own question with Scripture verses that every Jew knew.  These verses did not have  hidden meaning so that a person needed to be an expert in the Law of Moses in order to understand them.)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "justify" in KBT in the "just, justify, justification" entry.
\bttq What was the man's next question?
\an "Who is my neighbor?"/"To whom does [that word] ‘neighbor' [really] refer"? (29)
\tqref LUK 10.30-32
\bttq How did Jesus answer the expert's question about whom a person should regard as his neighbor?
\tqe He told the man a parable. (30-35)
\bttq What happened to the Jewish man in Jesus's story who was traveling from Jerusalem to the town of Jericho?
\tqe Robbers attacked him. (30)
\tqe They took all his clothes. (30)
\tqe They beat him. (30)
\tqe They left him [lying there on the road] like a dead man/nearly dead. (30)
\bttq Did anyone else walk along that road?
\tqe Yes, a priest and, later, a man from the tribe/clan of Levi [who worked in the temple] [and even later, a Samaritan man,] each came along that road. (31-32)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "Levite" in KBT.
\an (Note: The first words in the Greek text in 10:31 indicate that the priest [and other people] did not often come along that road, so the injured man could have died there before another person found him and helped him. It would be good if the translation indicated that another person might not come along that part of the road until a long time after the robbers had beaten the man. See other translations for ideas.)
\bttq What did the priest do when he saw the injured man?
\tqe He passed by on the other/the far side of the road [and did not help the man]. (31)
\bttq What did the man from the tribe of Levi do when he saw that man?
\tqe He did the same as the priest had done, that is, he walked along the other side of the road as he passed the man without helping him. (32)
\tqref LUK 10.33-35
\bttq Who else came along that road to Jericho?
\tqe A Samaritan man came. (33)
\bttq What did the Samaritan man do when he saw the injured man?
\tqe He felt very sorry for the man [and wanted to help him]. (33)
\tqe He went up to the injured man, (34)
\tqe poured [olive] oil and wine on his wounds (34)
\tqe  and bandaged them. (34)
\tqe Then he put/placed the man on his own donkey (34)
\tqe and took him to an inn/hotel. (34)
\tqe There he took care of the [injured] man. (34)
\bttq What kind of oil do you think it was that the Samaritan man put on the other man's wounds?
\tqe It was juice from the fruit of the olive tree.
\bttq What did that Samaritan man do the next day when he left that inn?
\tqe He took out some money (two coins made of silver) and gave it to the owner of the inn to pay for whatever that injured man needed. (35)
\tqref LUK 10.36-37
\bttq Which man did the expert in the Law say was acting like a neighbor to the man who had been robbed?
\tqe The man who had mercy on him was the one who acted like a neighbor. (37)
\an (Note: If the assistant answers with, "The Samaritan", skip over the next question.)
\an (Note: Because of the bad feelings between the Jews and the Samaritans, this very religious Jew who was asking Jesus the question about eternal life and one's neighbor would not give credit out loud even to a Samaritan in a story by saying his nationality by name. He only described him by the good thing he did. If the language of the translation has a way to refer to a socially ostracized person or group, such as traditional enemies, see if that is an appropriate term for this expert to use here.)
\bttq Which man was that? The priest or the man from the tribe of Levi or the Samaritan?
\tqe The Samaritan was the one who had mercy.
\bttq What did Jesus tell the expert in the Law to do since he understood correctly which man had been the best neighbor?
\tqe He was to do just the same [as the Samaritan had done in showing mercy]. (37)

\dh Details
\bttq Luke wrote that these things happened "while Jesus and his disciples were on their way." Where were they headed?
\tqe They were going to Jerusalem.
\an (Note: See the answers and Note back at 9:51.)
\bttq Where did they stop along the way?
\tqe They stopped at the home of Martha [and her sister Mary]. (38-39)
\bttq What did Mary do while Jesus was at their house?
\tqe She sat at his feet listening to what he said. (39)
\bttq What did Martha do while Jesus was there?
\tqe She was very busy/upset with getting everything ready to feed and care for Jesus. (40)
\bttq While Martha was very busy, how did she feel about her sister Mary only sitting down?
\tqe She was upset. She asked Jesus if it didn't bother him that Mary was not helping her get things ready. (40)
\an (Note: The Greek words clearly show that Martha was upset and frustrated. The translation should show that, too in an appropriate way.)
\bttq What did Martha want Jesus to do about this problem?
\tqe She wanted him to tell Mary to help her. (40)
\bttq What did Jesus say about Martha?
\tqe He said that she was worried about many things, but only one thing was really needed/important. (42)
\bttq What was that one important thing? 
\tqe What Mary had chosen to do was the more important thing. She had chosen to learn from Jesus. (42)
\an (Note: Some Bible scholars say that the "one thing" referred to Martha preparing less food and thus having less work. Then it would have been easy enough for one person to get ready quickly and also have time to hear what Jesus had to say.)
\bttq Do the words of Jesus in verses 41-42 sound like he was angry with Martha?
\tqe (It should not sound like he was angry. He was chiding/correcting her, but he was gentle and sympathetic to Martha's desire to show her love to him.)
\bttq Do you think that Jesus told Mary to stop listening and to go help Martha?
\tqe No. (42)

\oh Overview

\bttq Who was the example whom the disciples wanted to follow in the way that they prayed?
\tqe Jesus was their example. (1)
\bttq Who do you think is the best example for us to follow when we want to know how to pray?
\tqe Jesus is. (All that is recorded in the Bible about Jesus praying and what he taught about praying is the starting point for how, when, and where we are to pray meaningfully to God.)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus wanted his disciples to learn about praying from the story he told about a man asking a neighbor for some food? (5-8)
\tqe They must come with their needs at any time and persevere/be persistent in praying.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe If even an unwilling human friend can be moved to act by a person who is persistent in his request for a need, how much more will God be moved by the persistence of one who prays to him for a need.
\bttq What do you think that Jesus wanted his disciples to learn about praying from the examples he gave about a human father responding to his son's request for help? (11-13)
\tqe God, our Father in heaven, is ready to hear our prayers and answer them even more than a human father would respond to his children's requests.
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 11.1-4
\bttq What did one of Jesus's disciples ask him to do for them?
\tqe He asked Jesus to teach them [how/what] to pray. (1)
\bttq How should a person who is praying address the one to whom he is praying, that is, God?
\tqe He should address him as/call him "Father". (2)
\bttq What was the first thing Jesus said to God in this prayer?
\tqe He said that he wanted to honor/revere God's name more as being holy.
\tqe -AND/OR-
\tqe He said that he wanted God's name to be honored/revered as being holy [by more and more people]. (2)
\bttq How is it possible, do you think, that a name can be holy?
\tqe It is holy because it is part of the person who is holy./A person's name reflects what that person is like.
\bttq What should a person pray about God ruling in people's lives? (2)
\tqe One should pray that the time for God to rule over his people should come [soon/quickly].
\tqe -AND/OR-
\tqe God's rule should come/happen to all people. // All people should submit to God ruling over them. // May all people know/acknowledge God as their king.
\an (Note: The language of the translation may not allow an abstract object, such as a kingdom, to "come". Ask about this if the text appears to be a literal translation.)
\bttq If God is not ruling over some people, who do you think is ruling over them?
\tqe The devil is ruling them./Satan is ruling them.
\an (Note: A person may think that he is ruling/guiding himself, but that is not true. If God is not ruling, then that person has allowed himself to be under Satan's control.)
\bttq How/What should a person pray about his food?
\tqe He should ask God to help him get what he needs for that day. (3)
\an (Note: See the Note at 9:13 about "bread".)
\bttq What should a person pray about God forgiving his sins?
\tqe He should tell God that, because he is ready to forgive all other people who are indebted to him [in some way], he is ready to ask God to forgive him his sins. (4)
\bttq How does a person forgive another person who is indebted to him/who has sinned against him?
\tqe Key Term Check: He stops thinking about that person as having done something wrong against him. That means that there is no need for that person to compensate him in any way, such as by being punished or by giving him good things or by doing extra actions which would please him. The one who forgives does not think of that other person as being a bad person any longer. (See "forgive" in KBT.)
\an (Note: This is the same thing that God does when he forgives a person [see 1:77]. If the speakers of the language used in the translation use a term for God forgiving people which is different from the term the people use for forgiving others, check what the people's reasons may be. This can be checked by switching the verbs for forgiveness and asking what makes each one acceptable or unacceptable in the people's minds. The Greek text uses the same word in both references. God expects us to do the same as he has done for us [Luke 6:37; Matt. 6:14-15; 18:32-35; Mark 11:25].)
\bttq What should a person pray about his being tempted to disobey God?
\tqe He should ask God to lead him in ways where Satan is not waiting to tempt him. // God should not permit him to enter into situations where Satan will tempt him to sin.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He should ask God not to allow him to do anything that day which would cause God to stop protecting him and, thus, leave him open to the devil's temptations. // He wants God to keep him living according to/submitting to God's perfect will/desires so that Satan has no way to control him.

\tqe Another friend who had traveled to visit him had arrived, and there was no food [in the house] to serve him. (6)
\bttq Why did the neighbor friend not want to open the door and give this man some food?

\bttq Why did he finally get up and give the man who was standing outside all the food he needed?
\tqe Because the man who was outside was persistent/kept on asking him for the food, the neighbor gave him all that he needed. (8)
\bttq Whom, do you think, the man inside the house and the man who was standing outside represented in Jesus's story?
\tqe The man inside the house represented God,
\tqe and the man standing outside represented the disciples or anyone who requests God's help.

\bttq What did Jesus say that a person is to do if he needs something?
\tqe He is to keep on asking [God for it], seeking [for it] and knocking on God's door [because of it]. (9)
\an (Note: Most writers of commentaries mention that the three phrases convey a sense of increasing intensity to get whatever is needed, knocking on a door being the most intense. However, knocking may not be the normal way in the culture of the readers of this translation to show one's desire to interact with the people inside a neighbor's house. For help in adjusting the translation to be culturally appropriate, see TN, Luke 11:9c.)
\bttq What did Jesus say was the reason that he told the disciples to pray in that manner?
\tqe Everyone who prays in that way receives or finds what they needed, or [God] opens his door, [and gives it to them]. (10)
\bttq What two examples did Jesus give of how a father would not treat a request from his son?
\tqe If his son asked for a fish, the father would not give him a snake instead. (11)
\tqe If his son asked for an egg, he would not give him a scorpion. (12)
\bttq How did Jesus compare his disciples with God?
\tqe He said that they were bad in contrast to God who is perfect. Even so, they gave good things to their children when they asked. God wants [and is ready] more than they to give perfect gifts, even his own Holy Spirit, to those people who will ask him. (13)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 11.14-23
\bttq Jesus implied that what he had done by the power of God was to show/reveal something to the people. What should the people have understood?
\tqe Casting out the demon from a man was a sign that the kingdom of God had come to them/was happening among them [because Jesus was the one whom God had sent to save them]. (20)
\bttq How did Jesus's statements about the parts of a divided kingdom being against each other apply to what had just happened?
\tqe He was referring to what the people had been thinking when he cast out the demon. (18b) If he was one of Satan's workers, he would not cast another of Satan's workers out of a man. That would only weaken Satan's kingdom. Their thinking did not make sense.
\bttq People had responded to Jesus and his message in different ways. What did Jesus say about those different responses?
\tqe The people were either for him or against him. There was no middle/neutral choice. (23)

\tqe As the demon went out, the man [who had been] mute/dumb began to speak. (14)
\bttq How did most of the people who saw that react?
\tqe They were amazed. (14)
\an (Note: Luke already has used this same Greek word "thaumazw" eight times to describe people's reactions to things they saw or heard. Check again at 8:25 and 9:43 to see whether the translation has described this action consistently. Luke wrote that the same thing happened each time, so the translation should reflect that, too.)
\bttq How did some people react?
\tqe Some of them said that Jesus was using Beelzebub's/Beelzeboul's power. (15)
\bttq Who is Beelzebub/Beelzeboul?
\tqe He is the leader/ruler of the demons. (15)
\bttq What other name did Jesus use for this leader of the demons?
\tqe He used the name Satan. (18)
\bttq How did other people react?
\tqe They asked Jesus to show them a sign/miracle from [God in] heaven. They wanted to test him, [that is, to prove that his power and authority really were from God and not from Satan]. (16)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They asked Jesus to cause a sign/miracle to happen in the sky or to come from the sky. [Then they would know that God had sent him to do what he was doing.] (16)

\bttq What did Jesus say happens when the people in a kingdom or a house divide into groups and argue or fight against each other?
\tqe That kingdom or household loses its power and its unity and will be ruined/its power and influence will decrease greatly. (17)
\bttq How were the people, including Pharisees, to judge whether Jesus had used Satan's power or God's power to cast out that demon?
\tqe Since some of the Pharisees' own followers cast out the same kind of demons, the people should ask them if they used Satan's power to do that. (19) (Their own people would quickly show them that such an opinion about anyone, even Jesus, was wrong.)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "judge, judgment" in KBT.

\bttq Jesus used picture language again to try to make his point clear to everyone. Tell me the example you just heard.
\tqe A strong man guards his possessions so they are safe. (21)
\tqe When someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, [the stronger man] takes everything which had protected that man and divides that man's possessions [among his own friends]. (22)
\bttq To whom, do you think, was Jesus referring when he talked about those two strong men?
\tqe Jesus was referring to Satan as the strong man.
\tqe He was referring to himself as the stronger man who attacked.
\bttq To what, do you think, did the picture of Satan's possessions refer?
\tqe Satan's possessions were the people whom his demons controlled.
\bttq To what, do you think, did the weapons which Satan used refer?
\tqe Satan's weapons were the demons.
\bttq Jesus had just cast out a demon which had made a man unable to talk. What do you think was the way that relates to what Jesus said about robbing another person?
\tqe A robber must be stronger than the person he robs. Since Jesus had sent Satan's demons out of the man, then Jesus is clearly stronger than Satan. He overpowered Satan and won the victory.
\an (Note: Jesus had defeated Satan in the desert earlier [see 4:1-13]. Now he was taking away from Satan the people he had controlled. This was like taking away the things that Satan had owned. Jesus was giving out the benefits of his victory to the members of his own kingdom by freeing them from any demon's control.)
\tqref LUK 11.23
\bttq To what, do you think, did Jesus refer when he spoke about gathering and scattering something?
\tqe Jesus referred to gathering people [to follow him] into the kingdom of God. Satan does not want that to happen, so he does things to keep people out of God's kingdom.
\bttq Jesus had cast out the demon which had made a man unable to talk. What do you think was the way that relates to what Jesus said about gathering and scattering?
\tqe The people who had thought that Jesus had used Satan's power to cast out the demon were not helping Jesus [or encouraging others to come to him], but causing other people to stay away.

\bttq Who did the woman say was blessed/truly happy?
\tqe [Jesus's mother, being] the woman who had borne and breast-fed him was blessed/happy. (27)
\an (Note: The words which the woman spoke literally mean that the womb and the breasts were the things which were "blessed". She used the poetic pattern of her Hebrew/Aramaic language to express her meaning by using two parallel statements. The two statements together help us understand that the woman's focus was not on the body parts, but on the person to whom they belonged, Jesus's mother. The translation should reflect that focus, regardless whether it is culturally appropriate or not to speak about wombs and breast-feeding in a public gathering, such as a church service.)
\tqe Key Term Check: See the explanation of "blessed" at 6:20.
\bttq Who did Jesus say were even more blessed/happier than his mother?
\tqe Those [people] who hear the word of God and do [what it says] are even happier. (28)
\an (Note: Jesus did not say that his mother was not blessed, but that these people would be even more blessed than his own mother. Actually, his mother's great happiness/blessing was because she had listened and obeyed God's word which the angel had spoken to her [1:38, 45; 2:51].)

\rf Luke 11:29-32 Some people asked Jesus to do a sign/miracle for them.
\oh Overview

\bttq What sign did Jesus talk about?
\tqe He told them that the only sign about which he would do anything for them was [what they already knew had happened in the prophet] Jonah's life and his preaching (29). [He, Jesus,] the Son of Man would be like Jonah for them (30), and even greater than Jonah (32).
\an (Note: The things which the people of Nineveh had seen in Jonah's life are named in Matthew's account of this event [Matt. 12:38-42]. Jonah's message was that the people had to repent or be punished. This was the same message which Jesus now preached. Also, Jonah had spent three days and three nights in the stomach of a great fish. It seemed that he had died when he had been thrown into the sea, but then it was as though he rose from the dead when that fish spit him up on the shore. Jesus implied that something similar would happen to him. Because his wisdom was greater than Solomon's and his message greater than Jonah's, the people already had enough reason to believe in him.)

\tqe He said that those people who were alive then as he spoke were wicked. 
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He said that the people to whom he was speaking were wicked. (29)
\bttq What did Jesus say was a sign to him that they were wicked?
\tqe They [kept on] asking for a sign (which they would say proved that he had been sent by God and had God's power in him). (29)
\bttq The people would see the same kind of sign as the people of Nineveh had seen when Jonah preached to them long ago. But how had the way that the Nineveh people responded to Jonah been different from the way that the people were now responding to Jesus?
\tqe The people of Nineveh had repented when Jonah preached [to them] (32), [but these people had not repented when Jesus preached to them].
\bttq What judgment do you think Jesus was talking about in verses 31 and 32? (Reread those two verses.)
\tqe Jesus referred to the time/Last Day when God will judge all the people of the world. (See 10:14.)
\bttq What will the people of Nineveh do when God later judges all the people of the world?
\tqe They will be raised [from the dead by God] and condemn/accuse [the people who lived at Jesus's time] because those people did not repent [of their sins]. (32)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 11.33-36
\bttq What did Jesus try to teach the people by using this story about a lamp and its light and people's eyes?
\tqe The purpose of a lamp is to help people to see clearly when it is dark. God put Jesus on the earth to make the truths about [the kingdom of] God clear to those who believe the signs that God had sent him. Those clear truths will affect all areas of those believers' lives. The people who don't believe that about Jesus will not have a clear understanding even of the small amount of truth that they think they have.
\bttq What do you think those people should have realized right then in order that their whole lives would have God's truth in them? (36)
\tqe They should have realized that Jesus's words and work were showing God's truths to them. Only in believing and accepting that in their lives would they have clear understanding and direction in all that they thought and did.
\dh Details
\bttq Why do people light lamps?
\tqe People light lamps to give light so people can see when it is too dark otherwise. (33)
\bttq What does a person do with a lamp after he lights it?
\tqe He puts/places it where it can be useful, such as on a lamp holder. He does not hide it under anything. (33)
\bttq What part of our bodies did Jesus say is like a lamp?
\tqe He said that our eyes work as a lamp for our bodies. (34)
\bttq What did Jesus say was the way that a person's eyes work like a lamp?
\tqe Good eyes let in lots of light, so the person sees well.
\tqe But when eyes are bad, the person sees nothing/only darkness. (34)
\tqe -AND/OR-
\tqe Good eyes let in light and the whole body functions well.
\tqe When the eyes are bad, the whole body does not function well. (34)
\an (Note: The Greek words which Luke used for "good" and "bad" have two ways to be understood. One way is to understand them as evaluating physical things, like real eyes. The other way is to understand them as evaluating what God said about who Jesus was and how he wants us to live. Because this cannot all be included, generally, in the translated text, small footnotes or a glossary item may be needed to make both aspects of the meaning clear. The people who were listening to Jesus understood what he meant.)
\an (Note: Also see "darkness" described above at 1:79.)
\bttq (Read verse 35 again.) What hidden meaning, do you think, did Jesus want the people to understand from this?
\tqe Those people thought that they already had a clear understanding about God, but it really was not clear.
\tqe Actually, since they had not believed in Jesus, they real did not know God.
\an (Note: Using the figurative language of Jesus about light and darkness, we could say that because they did not have the light of Jesus in them, their lives were still in darkness.)

\tqe They should expect [that God would punish them by causing] horrible things to happen to them. (42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 50-51, 52)
\bttq What were the reasons that the experts in the Law should expect God to cause horrible things to happen to them also?
\tqe They made so many rules for the people, it was almost impossible to obey them all. The experts never helped/made it easier for the people to obey them, not even a little bit. (46)
\tqe They built tombs/special burial places for the prophets their own forefathers/ancestors had killed, and in that way showed that they approved of what their forefathers had done. Those experts in the Law were not honoring/obeying the prophets God sent them, [meaning John the Baptizer and Jesus,] any more than their forefathers had honored/obeyed God's prophets in their time. (47-51)
\tqe (Note: It was as if they were honoring their forefathers for having killed the prophets, not that they were honoring the prophets. It was as if the only good prophet was a dead one.)
\tqe They had not shared with the people how to really know [God or God's plan for the Messiah to save them nor how to understand the Scriptures which pointed to the Messiah]. This kept those who [wanted to] enter [the kingdom of God/a proper relationship with God] from doing so, and even they themselves were not entering. (52)

\bttq What did Jesus do that surprised the Pharisee?
\tqe Jesus did not first [ritually] wash before eating the [midday] meal. (38)
\bttq What did Jesus say about the Pharisees' concern about cleaning things?
\tqe They worried about [pleasing God by ritually] cleaning the outsides of [physical] things like plates and cups.
\tqe But at the same time, [they did not get rid of] their own bad thoughts and attitudes inside themselves [that did not please God]. (39)
\bttq What did Jesus say was inside those Pharisees that did not please God?
\tqe They were very greedy and very wicked. (39)
\an (Note: Jesus explained in Mark 7:15-23 about what should be regarded as clean or unclean in God's eyes. Both of the Greek words which name bad things here in verse 39 are also included in Mark's passage in a longer list of bad actions which come out of a person's heart and make him unclean.)
\bttq To whom, do you think, was Jesus referring when he talked about the one who made the outside and the inside of people? (40)
\tqe He was referring to God.
\bttq Since God made all parts of a person, which parts, do you think, does God want that person to be most concerned about? (40)
\tqe Probably he wants people to be concerned about all parts, but especially the inside, [because that is where bad actions start].
\an (Note: The person who answers this question will probably name the specific part of the body which he regards as the place of emotions, thoughts or belief. That is a good answer. The translation should not be so general that hearers will think that Jesus contrasted the physical outside with the physical organs inside the abdomen.)
\bttq In verse 39 Jesus said that the Pharisees' (centers of emotions, thoughts or belief) were very greedy/full of greedy actions. What does he say that they should do to show that they were clean inside (that is, they were free from sin)?

\bttq What did Jesus say that the Pharisees should do about the tithes they had been giving?
\tqe He said that they should not stop tithing when they began to judge people fairly and to love God. (42b)
\bttq How, do you think, were the Pharisees like unmarked graves?
\tqe [They appeared to obey God, but they were hiding their bad attitudes and actions. In a spiritual sense] they were like dead bodies rotting inside graves of which people were not aware. The people around the Pharisees did not know that they were like that [in their hearts].
\an (Note: The Pharisees were contaminating those people by teaching them to follow the Pharisees' own bad example. See Num. 19:16 to read how a person became contaminated by stepping on a grave.) (44)
\bttq What were the reasons that the Pharisees should expect [that God will punish them by causing] horrible things to happen to them? 
\tqe They were careful to give God one-tenth of every kind of little plant in their gardens, but they did not care at all about judging [others] fairly or loving God. (42a)
\an (Note: See 10:25-28 where these two things are agreed upon as being the two most important things God wants in a person's life.)
\tqe They loved to have [people] honor them when they were in public places, like the synagogue and marketplace. (43)
\tqe People [who thought that the Pharisees were good examples to follow in order to obey God] did not realize how bad/evil the Pharisees were on the inside, (that is, in their attitudes and actions). [In a spiritual sense] the Pharisees were dead and rotting. [That caused all the people who followed the Pharisees to become contaminated/unclean in God's eyes just as the Pharisees were.] (44)

\bttq How did one man respond to that powerful/strong talk of Jesus?

\an (Note: Those teachers said that they knew the most about what Moses wrote that God wanted in a person's life. The Pharisees made their own rules to help them live according to what these experts had said.)
\bttq Jesus used a word picture about "loading people down with burdens". If the translation contains that word picture, of what do you think that heavy load was a picture? (46)
\tqe The experts in the Law [of Moses] taught the people many of their own rules, thinking those rules would help people to obey God's rules.
\bttq Jesus also used a word picture about "lifting a finger" to do work. How much work do you think a person can do by using only one finger? (46)
\tqe A person cannot do any useful work by using only one finger.
\bttq How did Jesus apply that meaning to what the experts in the Law of Moses were doing?
\tqe They told the people to obey their many rules, but they did not help the people even a small amount [to obey them]. (46)

\bttq For which prophets will those Jews be punished by God?
\tqe God will punish them for all the prophets whom they and their forefathers had killed since the world was first made. (50-51)
\bttq Jesus used a word picture about a key. If the translation contains that word picture, to what do you think that Jesus referred when he spoke of  "the key of knowledge"? (52)
\tqe He referred to a correct understanding of their [Old Testament] scriptures, which would show the people that Jesus was the Messiah whom God had promised to send to them.
\tqe They would also see that they could then enter into a direct relationship with God, accepting his ruling and reigning over them [in the kingdom of God].

\tqe He wanted to keep all of it, but his storage buildings were too small.
\tqe He decided to take down the old buildings and put up larger ones.
\tqe He boasted to himself that his many good things would take care of him for many years.
\tqe Therefore, now he could have feasts and enjoy himself and not worry about working hard any more.
\tqe But God said that man was foolish to think only about himself and his future when he did not know that he was about to die that night.
\tqe Others would use all those things he had saved for himself. (16-20)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen to anyone who is selfish and greedy?
\tqe God will judge those people who are selfish, holding on to the things they possess [and do not share them].
\tqe He may make them die to show how foolish all their selfish work was. [Anyone who thinks only of his many possessions and does not think how to please God, will perish/will not have eternal life.] (21)
\bttq What did Jesus say a person should do instead of being greedy/selfish with the things he has?
\tqe Instead of trying to become rich with the things that make him happy,
\tqe a person should greatly enjoy using his money and abilities to do what pleases God. (21)
\bttq What do you think are ways that a person could greatly enjoy using his money and abilities to do what pleases God? (21)
\tqe He should first obey God and then use his material wealth in Christian love and compassion. He should try to relieve the needs of others in his family, in the family of believers, and among others. He should do it for God's glory, not his own.

\bttq How did Jesus respond to this man?
\tqe He said that [no one] had appointed him to judge how those brothers were to divide what they had inherited [from their father]. (14)
\bttq What did Jesus say about how a person should think about the things he possesses?
\tqe He said that possessing many things will not make a person's life better/happier nor will it make him live longer. // Having a good life is not based on how many things a person possesses. (15)

\bttq How did God feel about that man's thinking and his actions?
\tqe God called him a fool for not realizing he might/would die that same night and never enjoy all the things he had saved for himself. (20)

\rf Luke 12:22-34 Do not worry about the things you need.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 12.22-34
\bttq Why were Jesus's disciples not to worry about eating to stay alive and covering their bodies with clothing?
\tqe Being alive has more important aspects than worrying about [having enough] food.
\tqe Their bodies were also more important than what clothes they would wear on them. (23)
\bttq From all that Jesus had just said about the foolish rich man in verses 16-20, what do you think makes such worrying about one's food and clothes bad?
\tqe When a person worries, he thinks about only himself and what he wants, not about God and what he wants for us (28b, 34). It also has no lasting value (26, 33).
\bttq About what should a disciple or follower of Jesus be thinking and on what should he focus his life instead of worrying about food and clothing?
\tqe He should seek ways for God to rule and reign in his life and in the lives of others. Then [God] will provide those things [as the person needs them]. (31)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe When he allows God to rule in his life, God will provide whatever he needs to live, so he should not worry about those things. (31)
\bttq Since God has been pleased already to give blessings related to his kingdom/his ruling over us and providing for us, what should the people who are in God's kingdom do?
\tqe They should think more about using their possessions to help people who are in need, and think less about keeping things safe for themselves. When they help others, it is as though they are putting treasure in heaven to use and enjoy later. Their focus will be on pleasing God, not themselves. (33-34)
\dh Details
\tqref LUK 12.22-26
\bttq How were the ravens to be an example for Jesus's disciples?
\tqe They do not sow/plant [seeds] or reap/harvest [what they had sown/planted], and they do not have special places in which to store [extra food so they could use it later]. Even so, God provides food for them. (24a)
\bttq Since God does that for birds, which do not get ready for the dry time/cold time when no new food will grow, what should that show to the disciples?
\tqe It shows that God will provide them with at least all their basic needs. (24b)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe It shows that God will do more for them because they are worth much more [to him] than the birds. (24b)
\bttq How much longer did Jesus say that a person can make himself live just by worrying about it?
\tqe He said that a person cannot make himself live even one hour longer. (25)
\bttq Which part of a person's life can worrying about it help?/How does it help a person to worry?
\tqe No part of a person's life is helped./Worrying does not help in any way. (26)
\tqref LUK 12.27-31
\bttq What example did Jesus use next to teach his disciples not to worry?
\tqe He told about the wild flowers/lilies. (27)
\bttq How are the wild flowers to be an example for them?
\tqe They do not do any kind of work, but God makes them very beautiful anyway. Not even [ancient King] Solomon in all his beautiful clothes ever dressed as beautifully as one wild flower (27). 
\an (Note: The two kinds of work which Jesus named referred specifically to general physical labor, such as Jewish men did, and to the twisting of fibers into thread/yarn/string, which Jewish women did. If the culture of the translation has similar roles which divide the work of men and women, or if it has two other work roles to which they traditionally refer as indicating men and women, do try to use one of those divisions here.)
\bttq If God does that for the wild flowers which are alive only a very short time, what should that have shown to the disciples?
\tqe It should have shown that God would provide them with at least all their basic needs. (28)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe It should have shown that God would do even more for them because they would have a longer, lasting purpose than the flowers (28).
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus compared the beauty of the wild flowers to Solomon?
\tqe Solomon had been king of Israel a long time before Jesus lived. God made him the richest man in all the world. He could buy any beautiful clothing or jewelry that he wanted. Even so, God made the wild flowers more beautiful than King Solomon had ever been.
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus called his disciples "men of little faith"? (28b)
\tqe Since God is so caring and generous with insignificant [birds and] flowers, his own followers' worries must show their lack of faith/trust in God's ability or interest to provide for them. (28)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe The heathen/pagan people [who do not have a relationship with God] worry about/focus their lives on all such things. (30)

\tqe Jesus called his disciples a little flock of sheep.
\bttq How might the disciples be like a little flock of sheep which did not need to worry?
\tqe By themselves they could become lost and in danger without a shepherd, but [God,] their Father, was watching out for them and had been pleased to provide [them with his] kingdom/what they needed spiritually. He would provide their physical needs, as well. (32)
\bttq What did Jesus tell his disciples to do which would show that they were not worrying about the things they needed every day?
\tqe They should sell what they possessed and give [the money] to the poor [people]. (33a)
\bttq Instead of a person who follows Jesus valuing and gathering earthly possessions/treasures, what should he be valuing and gathering?
\tqe He should gather things having great value in heaven where they will never lose their value. He should not gather things like money which falls out of a purse when it wears out and has holes in it. No thief will steal those things in heaven and no moth will destroy those things by eating holes in them. They will last forever. (33)
\bttq What did Jesus say made this matter so very important to God?
\tqe What a person regards as very important will be the thing on which he focuses his thoughts and desires. If the focus of a person's heart is on earthly things, God will know that person is not focusing on him. A person should value pleasing God, not pleasing himself. (34)

\tqe He meant that he had come to announce that God would judge people's sin and punish them for it.
\tqe -OR-

\tqe They should decide what is right on their own. (57)
\bttq What picture language did Jesus use here?
\tqe He used the picture of one person taking another to the court to settle a dispute, apparently over money. If the person who has/owes the debt does not straighten the problem quickly, he may be thrown into the jail and be forced to stay there. (58-59)
\bttq What did Jesus imply was the right thing to do?
\tqe The person being taken to the judge/court should admit that he did wrong to his accuser/opponent and work hard to settle the problem quickly. (58)
\bttq What if the problem is not settled before facing a leader/ruler/judge?

\tqe They did not believe that Jesus's power and teaching showed that he was the one God had sent to be the Messiah or savior.

\bttq What did the ruler say to the people?
\tqe He said that they should come on one of the other six days [of the week when it was right to work] and be healed then. (14)
\bttq What did Jesus call this man and the others who felt the same way?
\tqe He called them hypocrites. (15)
\bttq What reason did Jesus give for calling the synagogue leaders hypocrites?

\an (Note: If the leaders thought that God cared about how they treated their animals on the Sabbath Day, then he surely cared much more about one of his chosen people. The synagogue leaders considered healing to be work. Jesus pointed out that caring for their animals also was work! Therefore they were hypocrites regarding not working on the Sabbath.)

\tqe Not many will enter./Not nearly as many will enter as tried to enter. (24)
\bttq To whom, do you think, did the owner of the house in the parable really refer?
\tqe He referred to Jesus.
\an (Note: Jesus is understood to be the owner, rather than God, his father. That comes from other times when Jesus spoke of the banquet/feast as a wedding feast in which he is the bridegroom. It can also be implied from verse 25 in the passive verb "has been raised/has risen".)
\bttq What will people do after Jesus closes the door of the kingdom?
\tqe People will stand on the outside knocking and asking the Lord to open the door for them. (25)

\bttq How will those people who are outside the kingdom try to show that they thought that they had a relationship with Jesus?
\tqe They will say they ate [meals] with him and that he had taught in their streets/towns. (26)

\tqe They will come from all the directions/parts of the world, (east, west, north, and south) [where the Gentiles/the non-Jews live]. (29)
\bttq Who do you think are the people whom Jesus said were last, but will be first in the kingdom of God? (30)
\tqe Some of the people from all over the world [who are not Jews, or who are not important in ways that the world thinks is important, or who hear last about Jesus as their savior].
\bttq Who do you think are the people whom Jesus said were first, but would be last in the kingdom of God? (30)
\tqe Some of the Jews [who thought that God would automatically allow them to enter because they were descendants of Abraham]. (God had said that they were his special people. They also had been the first culture to hear the Good News about being saved.)
\bttq What is the reason, do you think, that those people will be as angry and frustrated as the people in this parable?
\tqe They will see some of their ancestors and other Jews there in the kingdom and will feel they, too, should be there because they are also Jews. But Jesus does not choose people on that basis, so they are left outside the kingdom (and the blessings people will receive there).

\bttq What did Jesus say were the reasons that he spoke so sadly about Jerusalem?
\tqe Jesus spoke sadly because [the people of] Jerusalem had often killed the prophets and other messengers God had sent to them, (34)
\tqe and they had been refusing his (Jesus') attempts to protect them from dangers. (34)

\bttq Tell me about stoning people. (Use this question only if the translation does not already make the meaning clear.)
\tqe Stoning refers to throwing stones, big or small, at a person for the purpose of killing him. Usually many people joined in the throwing.
\tqe (Note: Stoning was a way that God had said the Jews were to punish a person who blasphemed him. When the people of Jerusalem had stoned God's messengers, it was because the people or leaders had not accepted those prophets' messages as having come from God. They said that the messenger had made fun of God and had been disrespectful to him. The punishment for that was to die by stoning. See Lev. 24:13-16.)

\an (Note: The Roman army did destroy Jerusalem and the temple and sent all the Jews away from there while the disciple John was still living. See Matt. 27:25.)
\bttq To what time, do you think, was Jesus referring when the people of Jerusalem/the Jews would finally ask the Lord God to bless him? (35)
\an He referred to the time when Jews would believe that he was the Messiah whom God had sent.
\an -OR-
\an He referred to the time while he was still alive when he would arrive in Jerusalem for the last time (now called Palm Sunday), when the crowds of people at Jerusalem would welcome him. (See 19:38.)
\an -OR-
\an He referred to the time when he would come back to earth from heaven as God's representative.

\bttq What do you think was the reason that the people/Pharisees who were there were watching Jesus carefully?
\tqe There was a man with swollen arms and legs there in front of Jesus (2). They probably wanted to see if Jesus would heal him on the Sabbath Day.
\an (Note: The experts in the Law were right there to be witnesses who later could accuse Jesus of breaking God's Law and, thusly, deserved to die [Exod. 20: 8-11; Num. 15:32-36].)
\bttq How did the Pharisees and the experts in the Law answer Jesus's question to them?
\tqe They were silent./They did not answer him. (4)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the Pharisees and experts in the Law did not answer Jesus?

\bttq How did the Pharisees and the experts in the Law respond to Jesus?
\tqe There was nothing they could say in response to that. (6)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 14.7-14
\bttq What did Jesus tell the people at the Pharisee's feast about receiving great honor and not great shame?
\tqe People who seek honor for themselves will be shamed/embarrassed/humiliated. It is the person who is humble whom [God] will honor. (11) (A person should not expect to be honored. Others should decide if, or how, a person is to be honored.)
\bttq What did he tell them about being a good host?
\tqe The host should honor the poor [people] and those who have physical problems by inviting them to special meals. (12-14)
\bttq How should people decide when they should be honored and when other people should be honored?

\tqe The host might come with someone else who has greater honor than he does.
\tqe The host might tell him to move to some other place because the host wants to honor the other guest more. (8-9)
\bttq How would that first guest feel? What would he have to do?
\tqe The first guest would be embarrassed to have to move to the place of least honor. (9)
\tqref LUK 14.10-11
\bttq What did Jesus say a guest should do instead of taking the place of most honor?
\tqe He said that the guest should choose the place of least honor. (10)
\bttq What might the host of the feast say to that guest?
\tqe He might say, "[My] Friend, move to a better (more honored) place." (10)
\an (Note: Many of the English language translations refer to the places of honor in this story with words such as "move up/higher/forward" or "move down/lower/backward" to reflect greater or lesser honor. That is culturally appropriate for English, but may not be the appropriate way to express greater or lesser honor in the language of the translation. Use what is correct for the language of the translation.)

\tqe All the other guests will see him being honored by the host. [And they, too, will honor him.] (10)

\bttq Of what do you think this great feast/banquet is a picture?
\tqe The feast is a picture of God inviting many people to enjoy all the blessings of being in his kingdom. (15)
\bttq What do you think will happen to all those people who are invited by God's servants/messengers and then do come to the feast?
\tqe They will enjoy all the blessings God has made ready for them.
\bttq Some people had been invited first, but refused to come when the servant/slave told them everything for the feast was ready. Who do you think that the people who were listening to Jesus understood those people to be?
\tqe They understood those people to be the Jews, [their own people].
\bttq What will happen to those people who had been invited first, but did not want to come to that feast?
\tqe Not one of them will be able to have even a small idea (or, figuratively, even a taste,) of how good God's feast/blessing is. (24)
\an (Note: Jesus implied that those people would not have another opportunity to come. God will not send his messengers to ask/invite them again.)
\bttq Read verse 15 again. Do you think that Jesus's parable showed that the man who spoke in verse 15 was right in what he said, or that he was wrong?
\tqe He was right about the blessings for those people who come to the feast,
\tqe but Jesus also made it clear that many who had first been invited had refused to come when everything was ready (17b-20). They would not receive another opportunity to enjoy the blessings, even though, earlier, they once had been invited (24).

\bttq Of whom do you think that the man who prepared a great feast is a picture? (16)
\tqe He is a picture of God.
\bttq A servant/slave went and told the people who had been invited that they should come immediately to the feast. Of whom do you think that the servant/slave is a picture? (17)
\tqe The servant is a picture of Jesus.
\bttq What do you think was the way that the people had been told earlier about the feast that God would have?
\tqe They had been invited long before by God's prophets. (Jesus had come at that time to tell those people that everything was ready.)

\tqe One person said that he had bought a field/garden/farm and had to go to see it. (18)

\tqe He told the servant/slave to go quickly to the city's streets and alleys
\tqe and bring the poor, or crippled, or blind, or lame [people whom he found there] to his feast. (21)
\bttq Do you think that the servant/slave went, did that and returned, or do you think that he had done it already, before the house owner told him to do it?
\tqe A servant/slave probably would not have done it before his lord/master told him to do so. He probably did go quickly and bring back those people he had found.
\an (Note: It may be that the brief wording here indicates just how quickly the servant went and did what his master had told him to do. If the translation seems to imply wrongly that he had already done this, suggest ways to avoid that wrong implication. One way may be to say very briefly at the end of verse 21 or at the beginning of verse 22, "The servant went quickly, did that and returned." A different way might be to say in verse 22, "The servant some time later said, ‘....'.")
\bttq What did that servant/slave report to his lord/master?
\tqe He reported that what the master had commanded/ordered [him to do] had been done,
\tqe and still there was room/space [for more people]. (22)
\bttq What did the lord/master of the house then tell his servant/slave to do?
\tqe The servant/slave was to go to the roads and paths [outside the city] and strongly urge those people to come in [to the house and the feast which was ready there]. (23)
\bttq How many more people was the servant/slave to bring?
\tqe He should bring enough people to fill the master's house. (23)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 14.25-35
\bttq What did Jesus say would prevent a person from becoming his disciple?
\tqe If that person did not hate his family members and even his own life, he could not be Jesus's disciple. (26)  (A disciple must be ready to let go of anything else that might prevent him from following Jesus completely.)
\bttq What do you think is the way that a person getting ready to build something is like someone getting ready to be Jesus's disciple?
\tqe When a person wants to build something, he must first evaluate the cost.
\tqe If he tries to be a disciple, but does not first evaluate everything, he may fail and other people may make fun of him. (28-30)
\bttq How is the way that a king prepares to fight a battle like someone getting ready to be Jesus's disciple?
\tqe When a king prepares to fight in a battle, he first evaluates whether or not he has a large enough army to defeat the enemy (31). If he does not, he [submits to the other leader and] seeks to settle the conflict peacefully.
\tqe If a person tries to be a disciple by his own resources, and does not first realize that he never will be able to do so on his own, he is sure to fail.  He must first be willing to give up his claim on all the things he has/owns [and submit to God]. (33)
\bttq What do you think is the way that salt which loses its flavor could be like a disciple of Jesus?
\tqe If a person tries to be a disciple, it is a very good thing, but if he does not first evaluate everything that might be required of him (26, 27, 28, 33), his life will be as useless/worthless as salt which has lost its flavor (34-35).

\bttq When a person is serious about following Jesus, how must he regard/think about his family?
\tqe Jesus said that he must hate his family, (that is, he must love Jesus more than he loves his family). (26)  (See 9:24.)
\bttq God tells us in other verses in the Bible to love and obey our parents and to love our wives and children. What do you think that Jesus meant here when he said that a disciple must hate the people in his family?
\tqe Jesus did not mean that we should literally hate our family. He was comparing a person's love for his family with a true disciple's love for him/God. Compared to how great a disciple is to love Jesus, his love for his family is like hate.
\an (Note: Jesus again was speaking extremely strong words/speaking in exaggerations to shock the people into paying close attention to what he meant. This was a way of teaching which Jewish teachers used then, and it was not meant for people to obey literally.)
\bttq How must that person regard/think about his own life and the things he hopes will happen to him?
\tqe He must hate that, too, [compared to how much he is to love Jesus] (26). (See 9:23.)
\bttq *What do you think it means to hate oneself?
\tqe It means that a person does not think only about staying alive at all costs. He also does not think only about gathering more of the things which make him happy. (Jesus wanted people to think about God and be totally committed to him first.)
\bttq *What do you think it meant at the time Jesus lived when a person carried his cross? (27)
\tqe It meant that person was on his way to die (by being nailed on crossed timbers until he could not breath anymore).
\tqe Key Term Check: See "cross, crucify" in KBT.
\bttq *What do you think it means for people today to carry/bear one's cross and follow Jesus? (27)
\tqe It means that a person must be willing to suffer whatever happens to him because he is one who follows Jesus. He must be willing to die, even die on a cross, as criminals used to die, in order to remain faithful to God. That person's focus must be on Jesus, not himself.

\bttq What happens to that kind of salt?
\tqe It is thrown out [on the ground as being useless]. (35)
\bttq When Jesus finished telling these three comparisons about a person being his disciple, he said that the people with ears should listen. Every person has ears. What do you think he meant? (35)
\tqe He meant that everyone should pay attention [and think carefully about the hidden meaning behind each illustration].

\tqe The father said that his younger son had been lost and now was found. (24b, 32c)
\tqe He also told others to celebrate with him about this. (23b, 24c, 32a)
\tqe He was rejoicing more over one sinning son who repented than over the faithful son who had stayed with him and thought that he always acted rightly (29) and did not need to repent. (7)
\bttq How is the father in the story a picture of God?
\tqe God is ready to forgive any sinner who truly repents and comes back to him. (17-24)
\tqe God and those who belong to him are happy when each sinner does repent and return to God. (23b, 24c, 32)
\tqe God wants all those people who feel they are better children of God's than some other people who come back to God later on (29) to recognize the true reason for rejoicing (32). The faithfulness of that long-term, continuous service to God will be adequately rewarded later (31), but that should not stop them from rejoicing every time a lost "brother" or "sister" returns to the family of God.
\bttq A variety of people were listening to Jesus tell these stories, the Pharisees, the teachers of the Law, the tax collectors and the "sinners" (15:1-2). In what ways, do you think, was Jesus talking about them in this parable?
\tqe The older son thought of his younger brother in the same way that the Pharisees and teachers of the Law thought of those people whom they referred to as "sinners". (29-30)
\tqe The younger son had done things which did not please his father, but he had finally repented and come back to ask his father to forgive him. He wanted to please his father now, just as the tax collectors and "sinners" were doing.

\bttq What did the younger son want from his father?
\tqe He wanted his share of the father's possessions, that part which would be his when the father died. (12)
\bttq What did the father decide to do about that?
\tqe He did divide his property/possessions between the [two sons]. (12)
\bttq In what way, do you think, was it divided between the two sons?
\tqe (The translation should not say or imply that it was divided equally. The Law of Moses [Deut. 21:17] had said that the oldest son would get an extra portion, or double what any other individual son might receive.)
\bttq What did the younger son do with his part?
\tqe He took it and went to a distant country/region and there he wasted his money in wild/extravagant/careless ways. (13)
\bttq What happened after his money was all spent/finished?
\tqe A severe/serious/great famine occurred all across that country/region
\tqe and he began to not have any [food]. (14)
\bttq How did he find enough things to eat?
\tqe He got himself attached to/joined up with a citizen/national of that country/region who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. (15)
\an (Note: The Greek word does not indicate whether this son now received any pay, but only that he was closely associated with a landowner there. If he was paid, it was a minimal amount, and not enough to buy an adequate amount of food.)
\bttq Do you think that this was good work or bad work for this boy/son?
\tqe It was bad work for a Jew to work for or live with a non-Jew. It was even worse to work with pigs, which were regarded as ritually unclean and unfit to be eaten. (See Lev. 11:7-8 and 24-26.)
\bttq How bad was his hunger?
\tqe Very bad. He was even willing to eat the pigs' food, but no one even gave him [that much to eat]. (16)
\tqref LUK 15.17-20
\bttq What finally happened to this son when he was starving and the pigs may have been eating more than he was?
\tqe He came to his senses./His thinking became clear again. (17)
\bttq What did he realize when he began to think clearly about his situation?
\tqe His father's hired workers had more than enough food to eat, but he was starving to death. (17)
\bttq Did he think that, if he stayed where he was, he really would die?
\tqe Yes, he did.
\an (Note: Luke's use of the Key Term "destroy, perish" shows us how serious the famine was. The word used here is the same one Luke used in 8:24.)
\bttq What did he decide to do?
\tqe He decided to start out for home, (18)
\tqe admit to his father that he had sinned against [God in] heaven and against [his father] (18),
\tqe and ask his father to make him one of his hired workers, and not think of/call him his son (19).
\tqref LUK 15.20-24
\bttq What did his father do when he saw his younger son coming?
\tqe His father saw him while he was still a long distance away, (20b)
\tqe [his heart] was moved with pity/felt compassion [for him], (20b)
\tqe and running [to his son], he hugged him around the neck and kissed him. (20b)
\an (Note: The words used for the action of kissing as part of the Jewish cultural way for the father to greet his son here should be the same as was used at 7:45. Here, however, much more emotion can be included, as appropriate.)
\bttq What did the son say to his father?
\tqe He said, "Father, I have sinned against [God in] heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son." (21)
\an (Note: These words are exactly the same words and word order as in verse 18-19a. The translation should also have exactly the same wording in both places for these sentences. What the son said in verse 19b does not seem to have been said again to the father before he interrupted his son. Although the words of 19b are repeated in some Greek manuscripts, the most reliable ones do not have that sentence included here. If the translator wishes to have it in a footnote, then the wording should be exactly the same as in 19b.)
\bttq How do you know that the father did not do like his younger son had said?
\tqe The father wanted to dress his son in special clothes and jewelry (22)
\tqe and celebrate his return with special food for a feast (23).
\tqe He called the young man his son when he talked to his servants/slaves. (22-24)
\bttq What special clothes did the father tell the servants/slaves to dress his son in?
\tqe The best robe, a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. (22)
\an (Note: See TN for a description of what was culturally implied in the father's actions [20b] and words [22-23].)
\bttq What special food did the father tell the servants/slaves to get ready to eat?
\tqe The calf they had fattened. (23)
\bttq What did the father say was the reason that he wanted to feast and celebrate?
\tqe He said that this son of his had been [the same as] dead and [now] was alive again. (24)
\tqe The son had been [the same as] lost and [now] was found. (24)
\tqref LUK 15.25-32
\bttq Why did the older son ask a servant about what was going on in the house?
\tqe He had been in the field. (25)
\tqe When he came near the house he heard music and dancing. (25)
\bttq What did that servant tell him?
\tqe He told him that his [younger] brother had come [back] (27)
\tqe and his father had [ordered servants to] kill the fattened calf [and roast/cook it]. (27)
\bttq How did the older brother feel about that?
\tqe He became angry and did not want/he refused to enter [the house]. (28a)
\bttq What did the father do about his older son?
\tqe He came out[side] and kept on urging/earnestly asked for/strongly requested him [to go into the house and join in the celebrating]. (28b)
\bttq What did the older brother tell his father were the reasons that he was angry?
\tqe He had worked like a slave for his father for so many years and had never disobeyed his orders, but the father had never given him [even] a young goat in order that he might have a party with his friends. (29)
\tqe But for his brother who had used up [the money from] their father's property with prostitutes, and [just now] come home, the father had [servants] kill the fattened calf! (30)
\an (Note: The older son's choice of words shows that he felt as if his father had slighted him, that the father was rewarding the younger son's foolishness and disobedience and not rewarding the older son's hard work and obedience. If the translation can convey that feeling of anger and disappointment, it would reflect Luke's text well.)
\bttq What did the father say to show that he was not treating his older son badly?
\tqe He said that the older son had always been with him and everything the father owned now belonged to the older son. (They had been together enjoying life and those possessions all along and still had them!) (31)
\bttq What did the father say to show that he was not celebrating the younger son's past foolish actions?
\tqe He said that he had to celebrate because the younger brother had returned from [foolish actions which were like] being dead or lost. Now he was alive again and found. (32)

\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 16.1-13
\bttq On what point did Jesus want his disciples to focus their attention from this parable? (See 16:8.)
\tqe The servant manager had thought shrewdly about his situation and had prepared for his future life. This was typical of people who deal with each other in worldly things. They do that better than the people who focus on spiritual things do. (8)
\bttq If a person cannot be trusted with the things God has given him on this earth, how will that affect spiritual things which God would like to give him?
\tqe God will not reward that person with things of great spiritual/eternal value. [They belong only to those who are faithful.] (11-12)

\tqe He was worried that he now had no work [to earn his living]. (3)
\bttq Why did he not want to get work digging gardens or begging for money from other people?
\tqe He said that he was not strong enough to dig and too ashamed to beg. (3)
\bttq What did he do to make sure he would have friends who would help him after the rich man put him out of the servant manager work? (4)
\tqe He allowed each one of the people who owed debts to the rich man to make their debt much smaller than the servant manager had said it was earlier. (5-7)
\bttq What kind of things did some people owe the rich man?
\tqe [Olive] oil (6) and wheat (7).
\bttq How many people did the servant manager help?
\tqe Each [and every] one. (5)
\an (Note: The translation should be clear that he spoke to, and helped, each person with a debt, not just the two people mentioned specifically.)
\tqref LUK 16.8-9
\bttq What did the rich man think about the servant manager doing like that?
\tqe He commended/spoke well of the (dishonest) servant manager because he had been so shrewd/clever [to take care of himself in his business dealings]. (8)
\bttq Which people did Jesus say are the more shrewd/clever when dealing with others who are like them?
\tqe He said that they were the people of this world. (8)
\bttq To which people, do you think, did Jesus refer as being "the sons/children/people of this age/world" and "the sons/children/people of the light"? (8)
\tqe The people of this age/world do not think about God or believe that he sent Jesus to save them.
\tqe The people of the light do think about God and do believe that he sent Jesus to save them.
\bttq How should the children of the light be like the people who are focused on the things of this world?
\tqe They should use wealth to make friends for themselves, so that when the wealth fails [to be able to take care of them, the new friends, or, the friends already in heaven, namely God and the angels] will welcome them into eternal homes. (9)

\tqe People can trust him with large amounts of money or goods. (10)
\bttq What did he say about a person who cannot be trusted with very small amounts of money or goods?
\tqe People cannot trust him with large amounts either. (10)
\bttq How did Jesus apply those thoughts to something which has small value and something else having true value?
\tqe He spoke about worldly wealth as something which has very little value (11),
\tqe and implied that true wealth and riches was made up of spiritual things.
\an (Note: Jesus spoke about this already in 12:32-34.)
\bttq Who do you think it is that wants to trust us with true riches? (11)
\tqe God.
\bttq What kind of person will be entrusted by God with true riches and possessions of his own?
\tqe The one who has been trustworthy with someone else's wealth. (11-12)

\bttq If a person's desire for money controls all his thinking and actions, then money is his master and he is a slave to it. What will that person's thoughts/attitudes be toward God?
\tqe That person will hate him or despise him/think of him with contempt.

\bttq What was the sin of the Pharisees which Jesus described in verses 14 and 15?
\tqe They wanted people to think of them as doing the right thing/having a right relationship with God, but God knew their hearts [were not focused on him, but on money or themselves]. (14-15)
\bttq What two topics did Jesus talk about in which the Pharisees did not obey God in a way that pleased him?
\tqe He talked about [their] love of money (14-15),
\tqe and about divorce and adultery (18).

\bttq Why did they not like what Jesus had said?
\tqe They loved money. (14)

\bttq What changed after John began to preach?
\tqe Since then the Good News about the kingdom of God was being proclaimed/preached [first by John, then by Jesus and his disciples]. (16)
\bttq What was that Good News?
\tqe It was that God wanted to rule over every person and reign in each one's heart and life like a king rules over the people who live in his country. That time had arrived when John and Jesus began to tell about the need for people to repent and believe that Jesus had been sent by God to save them from their sins.
\bttq What did Jesus say had been the result of that preaching?
\tqe He said that everyone was forcing/pressing/charging/trying hard to make his way into it. (16)
\an (Note: If the translation must make a specific interpretation of this sentence and not remain general, then any one of the following three choices is possible, but the first choice has the most support by Bible scholars:

\an -OR-
\an This refers to the those who did not believe the Good News, but were working hard to keep others out of the kingdom, such as the Pharisees or the devil were trying to do.)
\bttq Did what Jesus said here mean that the Law of Moses [and the writings of the Prophets] was no longer important or had no authority after he and John began to preach that the kingdom of God had arrived?
\tqe No. He said that it would be easier for the sky and earth to end/disappear than for one of the smallest parts of God's law to be gotten rid of. (17)
\bttq What example did Jesus talk about in order to show that he had not gotten rid of the Law?
\tqe He talked about divorce and adultery. (18)
\bttq What does a person do when he or she commits adultery?
\tqe Key Term Check: A married person has sexual intercourse with someone who is not that married person's spouse.
\bttq According to Jesus's explanation of the Law, who will also be guilty of committing adultery?
\tqe It is the one who divorces his wife and marries another,
\tqe and it is the one who marries a woman whose husband has divorced her. (18)
\an (Note: God's view of marriage, divorce, and adultery can be found in Gen. 2:24, Exod. 20:14, and Mal. 2:14-16. Jesus's explained what that meant in the kingdom of God in Matt. 19:3-9, and Mark 10:9, as well as here.)

\bttq This complete chapter has focused on wealth and one's relationship to God. How do you see this parable doing that?
\tqe This parable emphasizes obeying God's word as they know it and the importance of having the right attitude toward money and possessions. If people refuse to listen to and obey God's message which was in the Old Testament, then they will refuse the message about the kingdom of God which Jesus brought, even after seeing the miracles he did or seeing him after he rose from the dead.

\tqe He was very hot and thirsty in the middle of flames. (24)
\tqe [He implied that there was no way to relieve his suffering without outside help.]
\bttq The rich man called Abraham his father in verse 24. Then Abraham called the rich man his son. What was the real relationship between the two?
\tqe Abraham was the ancestor of all the Jews, so the rich man was being respectful of the man who started his entire group of people. Abraham replied with the appropriate response [in the Jewish culture].
\an (Note: The translation may use whatever terms from the culture would show respect for such a forefather and from that forefather back to his descendant.)
\bttq How did he want Abraham to relieve some of his pain?
\tqe He asked Abraham to have mercy/pity on him and send Lazarus to dip a finger in water and place it on the rich man's tongue in order to cool him off [a little bit]. (24)
\bttq What two reasons did Abraham give for not doing as the rich man had asked?
\tqe 1) He said that the rich man should remember that when he was alive, he had received his good things, but Lazarus had received bad [things]. Now in this place Lazarus was comforted/comfortable, and the rich man was in great pain/torture/agony. (25)
\tqe 2) He said that there was a great chasm/deep space/ravine which [God] had placed there so that persons on either side could not go over to the other side. (26)
\tqref LUK 16.27-31
\bttq Why did the rich man want Abraham to send Lazarus to his father's house/descendants?
\tqe He had five brothers whom Lazarus should warn [about changing/repenting] in order that they not also come to that place of great pain/torture/agony. (28)
\bttq What did Abraham say was God's way of warning them already?
\tqe They had [the writings of] Moses and the Prophets. They should listen to them [tell why they should repent]. (29)
\bttq Why did the rich man think that Lazarus would be able to convince them better than the Scriptures?
\tqe If someone [rose] from the dead, he thought that they would [definitely] listen. (30)
\bttq What did Abraham say about that?
\tqe He said that if [those brothers] would not listen to [the writings of] Moses and the Prophets, neither would they be convinced by someone who rose from the dead. (31)

\bttq To whom, do you think, was Jesus referring when he spoke about "your brother"?
\tqe He was referring to any close companion or fellow believer, and not directly to one's sibling. For the disciples, it would have especially meant any of the other disciples. (3b)
\bttq What are we to do if our companion sins?
\tqe We are to strongly warn/rebuke him. (3b)
\bttq What are we to do if that rebuke causes him to realize his sin and he repents?
\tqe If he repents, we are to forgive him. (3b)
\bttq What if he sins many times against us in one day, then repents each time?
\tqe If he repents, we are to forgive him every time. (4)
\bttq How many times did Jesus want the disciples to forgive others?
\tqe He said that the number "seven" in his example as representing as many times as that person repents.
\an (Note: The number "seven" in the language of the Jews, Hebrew, sounded like the word "vow, oath". This made the number have a strong sense of being fulfilled, of being complete. Thus, "seven" here stands for all the times that this situation might happen. In English, that sense is present when a person says something happened "a dozen times" or "a hundred times". The number's absolute value as "12" or "100" is not in focus so much as that a set of a large number of occurrences of that action has taken place.)

\bttq What do you think was the reason those men asked Jesus to have mercy/pity on them? (12-13)
\tqe They wanted Jesus to heal them.
\bttq Many sick people had come right in front of Jesus in order to be healed by him. What do you think was the reason these men called out to him from a distance?
\tqe God had told Moses not to permit people with leprosy/bad skin diseases to come close to others without letting the others know a person with leprosy was there. (See Lev. 13:9-17, 45-46 and Num. 5:1-5.)
\an (Note: If these Scripture-related cultural items are not known by the assistants, consider making a footnote or glossary item.)
\bttq God had told Moses that a person who had been healed of leprosy/bad skin disease should show his skin to a priest (see Lev. 13:9, 16-17, and 14:1-9). What happened to those ten men when they obeyed Jesus and started to go to a priest while they were still sick?
\tqe As they went, they were healed [and] made ritually clean again. (14)
\an (Note: See the note at 7:22 about the same Greek verb as Luke used here.)
\tqref LUK 17.15-19
\bttq What did the men do when they saw that they were healed?
\tqe Only one of them returned, praising God in a loud voice (15).
\tqe He quickly lowered his body, putting [his knees and] his face to the ground [in front of] Jesus's feet, and thanked him (16). [The rest went to see a priest, we assume.]
\an (Note: The Greek text emphasizes that this man was not a Jew, but a Samaritan. If that element of surprise can be included in the translation, it would reflect Luke's writing better.)
\bttq How do we know Jesus was surprised and disappointed at all this?
\tqe He asked [rhetorical questions] about where the other nine men were who had also been healed/made ritually clean. (17).
\bttq Why did he become so surprised and disappointed?
\tqe Because they had not returned to give praise to God, but only the non-Jew [Samaritan] had. (18)
\bttq What did Jesus say was the cause of the Samaritan man being healed/being saved?
\tqe He had faith/believed that Jesus could heal/save him [by God's power when no other way was possible]. (19)
\an (Note: The Greek verb used in this sentence means both things in this case. It can also be translated as "rescued". Jesus had healed all ten men. He may have meant here that this one man also had his sins forgiven because he had recognized the power of God at work in Jesus. [See 7:50.])
\bttq Jesus told this man to get up and go. Where was he going when he stopped and came back to Jesus?
\tqe He had been on his way, also, to show himself to a priest. (14)

\bttq Jesus talked much about the Son of Man returning/coming again. To whom, do you think, was he referring? (22, 24, 26, 30)
\tqe He was referring to himself.
\an (Note: See comments at 5:24.)
\bttq Jesus clearly implied that there would be a difference between the kingdom of God coming and the Son of Man coming again/returning. What was different in the way he talked about those two things?
\tqe The kingdom of God would not come visibly (21),
\tqe but the return of the Son of Man, Jesus himself, would be very visible (24).
\bttq What will people be doing when the Son of Man returns?
\tqe They will be doing their normal/ordinary activities, such as eating, sleeping, and working. (27, 28, 30, 34, 35)
\bttq After hearing about the flood and the fire from heaven in earlier times, what do you think that Jesus wanted his disciples to understand about what would happen suddenly one ordinary day when most people were not expecting it? (33-35)
\tqe He will return and save some [people, those who believe in him], but leave [all] the others [to be punished].

\bttq What did the Pharisees ask Jesus about?
\tqe They wanted to know when the kingdom of God would come. (20)
\bttq What did Jesus say was the reason that people would not recognize the kingdom of God when it came?
\tqe There would not be visible signs beforehand to signal the kingdom of God was about to come. (20)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe It would not be visible because it was inside people['s hearts]. (21)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe It would not be recognized because it was [already] among them [in the person and work of Jesus, but they had not yet realized it]. (21-22)
\bttq How were the disciples going to feel before long?
\tqe They would feel they wanted very much to see even one day of the Son of Man [in all his glory, or, ruling and reigning as king]. (22)

\bttq Would they see that happen soon?
\an No. (22)
\bttq What should the disciples do when someone would tell them where they could go to see the Son of Man?
\tqe They should not hurry to follow such people. (23)
\bttq Why should they not believe such reports that the Son of Man was in one place or another?
\tqe Because his coming would be [as dramatic and public] as lightning flashing from one part of the sky to another. (24)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe Because his coming would be [as dramatic and public] as lightning flashes in one part of the sky and lights up [all] the other parts, or lights up [everywhere] on the ground. (24)
\bttq What did Jesus say must first happen before the Son of Man would come in his glory?
\tqe He must suffer many things/in many ways/much.
\tqe The people alive at that time [who had seen his miracles and heard him teach] would reject him/his claim to be the Messiah. (25)
\tqref LUK 17.26-27
\bttq Jesus compared the way that the world would be like at the time he returns as the Son of Man with another time. To what other time did he compare it?
\tqe He compared it to the time [long, long before] when Noah lived. (26) (See Gen. 6 and 7.)
\bttq What were people doing in that time when Noah lived?
\tqe People [did their normal activities, such as, they] were eating and drinking, (27a)
\tqe and getting married. (27a)
\an (Note: If the culture of the translation has separate ways to refer to a man or a woman getting married, use both ways here. The Greek text does that, too. Only one term is used in the answer here because English just has one term, "get married", for both men and women.)
\bttq How long did people do those ordinary activities?
\tqe Right up to the day Noah [and his family] entered the ark/boat [he had built]. (27b)
\bttq What happened suddenly which changed what those people were doing?
\tqe [God sent] a flood which destroyed all [those people]. (27c)

\bttq What were people doing in that time when Lot lived?
\tqe People [did their normal activities, such as, they] were eating and drinking, (28)

\bttq To which "day" was Jesus referring in verse 31?
\tqe He was referring to the day when the Son of Man would be revealed/seen by all. (30)
\bttq What will people be doing on that day when he returns?
\tqe People [will be doing their normal activities, such as, some] will be [resting] on their [house] roofs, others [will be working] in their fields. (31)

\bttq What did Jesus say about people stopping what they are doing when he arrives and then getting ready for him?
\tqe He said that no one was to go where his belongings were [in order to save them from the disaster which was coming]. (31)
\bttq What example did Jesus give to show what would happen if someone did that?
\tqe He told them to remember [what happened to] Lot's wife. (32)
\an (Note: All the Jews who were listening to Jesus knew what had happened to Lot's wife. She had thought more about her possessions which she was leaving behind than about obeying God and him saving her. She died the same as all the other people who had not obeyed God. This may need to be in a footnote or glossary item. See Gen. 19:15, 17, and 26.)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen to the person who wanted to save his own life/keep on living the way he was?
\tqe He said that person would lose [his life]. (33a)
\bttq *That sounds like a contradiction in the way that people understand life and death. What do you think that Jesus meant by that?
\tqe The person who does not do as Jesus just said in verse 31 will lose his chance to have the spiritual, eternal life Jesus promised elsewhere in the gospels.
\tqe He may also die physically just like Jesus implied in verse 32 that Lot's wife died.

\bttq What did Jesus say would happen when a person loses his life because of his following Jesus?
\tqe He will save it/keep on living [eternally]. (33b)
\bttq *This, too, sounds like a contradiction in terms. What do you think that Jesus meant by that?
\tqe He cannot be talking about a person's physical life, so he must be referring again to spiritual life. The person who does as Jesus just said in verse 31 will receive the spiritual, eternal life which he promised to give him.

\bttq What will happen to people at that time?
\tqe Some will be taken along, some left behind, [even within families or among friends]. (34, 35)
\an (Note: Jesus had not said where he would be taking those people, but it would be somewhere safe. From what he said in 16:19-23, he implied they would be taken to heaven like the man Lazarus had been.)
\bttq What did the disciples want to know about this return of the Son of Man?
\tqe They asked Jesus where [his return would take place]. (30)
\tqe -OR-
\tqe They asked Jesus where [the things he just talked about in verses 30-35 would take place]. (37)

\bttq Tell me the parable about the widow and the judge.
\tqe (The answer should cover the basic outline of the story, including the judge's attitudes toward people, the widow being persistent, and the judge's reasons to finally answer her repeated requests.)
\bttq What did Jesus want his disciples to learn from this parable?
\tqe They should always pray [to God] and not get tired of it/give up/be discouraged doing it. (1)
\bttq How can we compare the judge and God?
\tqe The judge did not care about God or people (4), but God cares about the ones he has chosen (7).
\tqe The judge kept putting off helping the widow, even though she was persistent (3, 4), but God will not do like that; he will help quickly [when he decides to act] (8).

\bttq In what way did Jesus describe the judge?
\tqe The judge did not respect/revere God [and God's standard of right and wrong]
\tqe and he was not concerned about what people might think about the way that he decided court cases.     -OR-
\tqe The judge did not respect/revere God [and God's standard of right and wrong]
\tqe and he did not care about the people involved in the cases he decided. (2, 4)
\an (Note: The same Greek word was used to describe a judge in 11:19 and 12:58. The translation here should describe the judge and his role in as much the same way as it was in those verses.)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus meant when he said that the disciples should always pray to God?
\tqe He meant that they should pray very often and regularly to God and depend on him for all their needs. He did not mean they must only pray and do nothing else.
\bttq In what way did Jesus describe the widow?
\tqe She was persistent/kept on coming to the judge to do what was right. (3)
\bttq What did the widow want from that judge?
\tqe She wanted him to listen to her problem (3),
\tqe decide that another person was taking advantage of her (3),
\tqe and correct it [in her favor] (3).
\bttq Why did the widow keep on coming to that judge?
\tqe Because he would not take the time to listen to, and settle, the woman's complaint. (4)
\bttq Why did he finally do what the woman had wanted for a long time?
\tqe Because she was bothering him/wearing him out with her repeated requests. (5)
\tqref LUK 18.6-8
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus said that his disciples were to pay attention to what the corrupt judge had said/thought?
\tqe The judge said that he would help the woman because of her being persistent (5). Jesus then made a comparison to God answering our prayers to him (7-8).
\bttq If the people God has chosen as his have a need and are serious to have him help them, what are they to do? 
\tqe They are to pray day and night/very regularly each day for that need. (8)
\bttq Who do you think these people are whom God has chosen?
\tqe Key Term Check: They are the people who believe that God sent Jesus as the Messiah/Christ to earth to save them from their sins. God knows who will believe that and he will save them. He also knows who will not believe that and he will punish them. (See Deut. 7:6-8a, 9:4-6; Matt. 22:14; John 15:16; and Rom. 8:28-33.)

\bttq What did Jesus explain/teach by means of this parable to those who were listening to him?
\tqe A person who sins and humbly pleads for God to remove his sin/to be merciful to him [and forgive him] is declared right/acceptable by God.
\tqe Those who believe that they can depend of their own good actions [to make them right with God] and who think that they are better than all other people will not be declared right/acceptable by God. They will be humiliated/shamed/embarrassed [by him] (14).
\bttq What kind of person is it whom God will greatly honor?
\tqe It is the person who humbles himself [before God and other people]. (14c)
\bttq What kind of person is it whom God will greatly shame/humiliate/embarrass?
\tqe It is the person who greatly honors himself. (14b)

\bttq Where did the two men go to pray (to God)?
\tqe They went to the temple [grounds]. (10)

\bttq To whom did the Pharisee compare himself when he prayed (to God)?
\tqe He compared himself to all other people [and made them look bad while he made himself look good]. (11-12)
\bttq What did the Pharisee say were reasons that he thought that God should honor or help him?
\tqe He said that he was not like all the other people, whom he said robbed people, cheated people/did evil things, committed adultery or collected [more money than they should for] taxes. (11)
\tqe [He implied he was better than others when] he said that he fasted two times each week and gave one-tenth of all that he got. (12) (See 11:42a.)

\bttq What did that man say were reasons that he thought that God should help him?
\tqe He asked God to have mercy on him [and] remove/forgive his sin. (13)
\an  (Note: The Greek verb Luke used here includes more than the one English language action of "have mercy". Both of the actions in the answer above should be included in the translation. [See L&N entries 40.9 and 88.75.])
\bttq What did that man do which shows us that he was humble?
\tqe He stood at a distance [apart from others] (13),
\tqe he would not even look up toward [God in] heaven (13),
\tqe but was beating on/thumping his chest [as a sign of his sorrow over sins] (13).
\tqe The words of his prayer show that he did not think of himself as worthy of anything good from God. (13)
\bttq What did Jesus say was the result of those two men's prayers?
\tqe God declared/made this tax collector right in his sight, that is, he forgave him,
\tqe but that Pharisee was not forgiven/made right with God. (14a)

\tqe They would be the people who would not [humbly] accept his authority over them, like young children [accept authority over them]. (17)

\bttq What kind of life do you think eternal life is? (18)
\tqe Key Term Check: It is a life that is not affected by time limits, such as whether a person is still alive physically or not. It can begin now while we still are alive and will go on forever, even after our bodies die. Jesus in his dying and rising on our behalf made it possible for us to have that eternal life. God graciously and freely allows us to have that new life. It is a life of having a close relationship with God, obeying him as he rules over us. (See "life" in KBT.)

\tqe Do not commit adultery.
\tqe Do not murder.
\tqe Do not steal.
\tqe Do not lie when you testify in court.
\tqe Show honor to your father and mother.
\bttq What did the man say about those commands from God?
\tqe He said that he had done [what they said to do] since he had been a child. (21)
\an (Note: The Greek verb Luke used here is the same one he used in 11:28. Because the context in both places is the same, it would be best to translate it the same way in both verses.)
\bttq According to Jesus, what more did the man have to do?
\tqe He must sell everything he had (22)
\tqe and distribute [that money] to the poor [people who did not have the things they needed] (22),
\an and then follow Jesus (22).
\an (Note: The translator may want to have a footnote or glossary item which indicates that Jesus was showing the man that there was still one more command which he had not obeyed in his dealings with other people. In the list of ten commands which God had spoken to Moses, the last one spoke about coveting, that is, wrongly desiring to have things. That sin was preventing this man from receiving the eternal life which he wanted. His desire for things got in the way of his desire for God.)
\bttq If the man did do that, where would he have anything of great value any more?
\tqe Jesus said that he would have [spiritual] things of great value in heaven. (22)
\bttq Why did the man become very sad/grieved?
\tqe He was very/extremely rich [and loved the things he possessed]. (23)

\bttq To what did Jesus compare a rich person entering the kingdom of God?
\tqe He compared it to a camel going through/entering the eye of a needle. (25)
\bttq Which one of those two things did Jesus say would probably happen more easily?
\tqe It would [almost] be easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle (than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God). (25)
\bttq We know that no animal can go through the small eye of a needle. What do you think that means for the rich person and entering the kingdom of God? (25)
\tqe It is also impossible for people who depend on their earthly riches instead of only trusting God.
\tqref LUK 18.26-30
\bttq After Jesus made that comparison, how did the people who were listening respond?
\tqe They asked who could [possibly] be saved [from God's punishment, if what Jesus had said was true]. (26)
\bttq What was Jesus's answer?
\tqe The things [which are] impossible for man are possible for God. (27) (God can do what people cannot do. God saves a person. The person cannot save himself by possessing many things.)
\bttq What did Peter say about the disciples and the things they had possessed?
\tqe He reminded Jesus that they had left [all] their own things/family to follow him. (28)

\bttq Why did the blind man ask others what was happening?
\tqe He heard a crowd going past [him]. (36)
\an (Note: This implied that something important was happening, or that someone important was passing by. An important person with a crowd of people following him might be generous to the blind man when all those other people were watching.)

\tqe Later they talked at Zacchaeus's house. (6-9)
\bttq How did Jesus's visit with Zacchaeus change Zacchaeus's way of living?
\tqe He gave half of his possessions to the poor [people] (8)
\tqe and, if he had cheated anyone of anything, he promised to pay back four times as much. (8)
\an (Note: Although the Greek words are translated "If …," and leave the point unclear in English, the Greek grammar shows that Zacchaeus was admitting that he had sometimes cheated people concerning their taxes. He said, in effect, "To those people whom I have cheated, I now offer four times the amount back.")
\bttq What did Jesus say was the real purpose of him stopping to talk to Zacchaeus and staying at his house?
\tqe [He], the Son of Man, had come [to this earth] to search out and save those [people like Zacchaeus] who knew they were [spiritually] lost/without hope. (10)

\bttq Many people saw Jesus and Zacchaeus talking and walking together. What did they all think?
\tqe They were muttering/grumbling [among themselves] that Jesus had entered the house to stay overnight with a [man they assumed to be a blatant] sinner. (7)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Zacchaeus spoke about giving away his money?
\tqe His work was with tax money and giving those taxes to the [enemy] Roman government. People thought, or knew, that Zacchaeus had gotten rich by keeping more of that tax money than was right.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe He changed because being with Jesus made him sorry for his past wrong actions.
\bttq What did Jesus say about Zacchaeus's promises?

\bttq How might Jesus have wanted the listeners to understand his parable?
\tqe Jesus would be going away and would not return until God made him to be king over all the people. In the meantime, other Jews would oppose him being the king over them. They should only expect to receive punishment when he returns.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe While he would be gone, his disciples must serve him faithfully and use the abilities he had given them for his overall good. Any disciple who was not faithful would be judged.

\bttq Why could going to the far away place/country not be a picture of Jesus now going to Jerusalem?
\tqe Because Luke wrote that they were near Jerusalem. (11)
\bttq What did that important man say and do to ten of his servants?
\tqe He gave them each a valuable gold coin and told them, "Do business [with this money] until I come back." (13)
\bttq How long would a man from your village have to work to earn that much money?
\tqe (The answer should be closely equal to the pay for 100 days of work.)
\an (Note: If the translation uses a reference to "coin" or to the Greek name of that coin, "mina", a footnote or glossary entry would be helpful to explain the value of it. Each servant received money equal to the pay for 100 days of work.)
\bttq What did the important man's fellow citizens/countrymen think and do about him going off to be made a king?

\tqe The first man had gained ten more coins/minas (16).
\tqe The second man had gained five more coins/minas. (18)

\tqe He was afraid of the master, knowing he was a difficult man to please. (21)
\bttq What did the master/king say to this servant?
\tqe He said he would judge the servant by the same words the servant had just used to describe the master, that is, by being very tough on him for not at least investing/loaning it out and collecting interest for the master. (22-23)
\bttq [Read verses 22-23 again. Then ask this question:] How do those words of the important man in your language sound to you? Do the words make you think that he was happy or frustrated or sad or angry?
\tqe He was frustrated and angry.
\an (Note: The question form in Greek is rhetorical and shows these feelings. The translation should use its own appropriate grammar or choice of words to convey the same feelings.)
\tqref LUK 19.24-27
\bttq What did the master/king do about this servant who had done nothing with the money?
\tqe He told other [servants] who were standing nearby to take the man's coin/mina and give it to the one who had [gained] ten. (24)
\bttq What was the people's reply?
\tqe They sound like they thought that the master's/king's command was not fair because that servant already had many coins. (25)
\bttq What did the master/king (or, Jesus,) say that the people were to learn from the way that the king treated the servants in the parable?
\tqe For the person who has faithfully served [God], [God] will reward/give even more to him. (26a)
\tqe For the person who has not faithfully served [God] with [the little bit] which [God] gave him, [God] will even take that away. (26b)

\tqe Since they did not believe that God had given authority to John to baptize, then they also would not believe that God had given him (Jesus) authority to do what he had been doing. Therefore, it would be useless to say that God had sent him. They would not believe him anyway. (4-8)

\tqe They wanted to have all the fruit from the vineyard and even own the vineyard themselves. (10b-15a)
\bttq What do you think was the reason those who listened to Jesus's parable did not want such a terrible thing to ever happen to them? (16b)

\tqe Jesus was also telling them with this picture language that God had sent Jesus, his much-loved son, also, but the leaders had rejected him and would kill him outside the city.

\bttq Some men told Jesus that they wanted to know about paying taxes to the enemy Roman government, but what did they really want?
\tqe They wanted to make Jesus say something against the Roman government so they could arrest him and put him under the authority and control of the Roman government. (20)
\bttq What did Jesus say about obeying the government's laws, such as paying taxes?
\tqe He said that people should do whatever the king/government says they all must do, such as pay their taxes,
\tqe (and they should also do whatever God says they all must do). (25)

\bttq Who were sending men to spy on Jesus and catch him saying something wrong?
\tqe They were the teachers of the Law and the chief priests mentioned in verse 19.
\bttq How did those spies get near to Jesus in order to listen and ask him questions?
\tqe They pretended to be concerned about doing the right thing. (20a)

\bttq What did the spies tell Jesus that they knew about him?
\tqe They said that they knew he spoke and taught correctly
\tqe and that he was not influenced by who people were,
\tqe but that he truthfully taught the way that God [wanted people to live]. (21)
\bttq What did they want to know about taxes?
\tqe They wanted to know if it was proper [for a Jew] to pay taxes to [the Roman Emperor/king] Caesar. (22)
\tqref LUK 20.23-26

\tqe and those which God had said were necessary. (25b)
\bttq How well did those men's plan work, their plan to catch Jesus saying something wrong in front of many people?

\tqe They were so amazed at his answer that they were silent/they had nothing more to say. (26)

\rf Luke 20:27-40 Some Sadducees asked Jesus about people being married after they died and rose to live again.
\oh Overview
\tqref LUK 20.27-40
\bttq Tell me the little story about seven brothers which the Sadducees told to Jesus.
\tqe The first brother of seven married a woman, but died without children. (29)
\tqe The second [brother], then the third married her, but they also died childless. (30-31a)
\tqe The [rest of the] seven [brothers] were the same, [marrying her, but] leaving no children [when they each] died. (31b)
\tqe Lastly, the woman died. (32)
\tqe When people are raised by God to live again after dying, whose wife will she be, having been the wife of each of the seven? (33)
\an (Note: The translation should not imply that the woman caused the men to die. This is not a true story about real men. The Sadducees created the story to try to trick Jesus. Its focus is on the idea of rising again after dying.)
\bttq What did Jesus say about people and their rising after being dead?
\tqe He said that people [whom God] declared worthy would rise to live again after being dead (35, 37),
\tqe but they would not marry (35), because they cannot die again (36a),
\tqe like the angels are (36b).
\tqe [Those people] are children of God, because they have been raised [by God] to live again [with him] (36c-d).
\tqe Even Moses showed that the [people who are] dead will be raised [by God] to live again when he referred to [God when he spoke to Moses out of] the burning bush as the God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob, [ancestors who no longer were living on the earth] (37).
\bttq The Sadducees told Jesus that they wanted to know about people being married after they rose from being dead, but what do you think they really wanted?
\tqe Because they did not believe that people would rise again after being dead (27), they wanted to make Jesus look foolish as he tried to make an answer for something which they thought would never happen.

\tqref LUK 20.27-33
\bttq What did Luke tell us about the group called the Sadducees?
\tqe He said that they did not believe that people would rise after being dead. (27)
\tqe Key Term Check: The Sadducees were a group, like a political party. They were rich, important Jewish families. Most of the members were priests who regarded the Laws of Moses as the most important part of God's Word. They did not believe that angels or Satan were real. See "Sadducee" in KBT in the "Pharisee, Sadducee" entry.
\bttq What did the Sadducees say was the rule about marriage which Moses had written down and taught to the Jews?
\tqe If a man's brother died, leaving his widow, but no children, that man should marry the [dead brother's] widow and have some children for his brother. (28)

\tqe We think about the bodies of those people and say they are dead,
\tqe but God looks at their spirit and says they all live on.

\tqref LUK 20.39-40
\bttq Who praised Jesus for his good answer? 
\tqe Some of the teachers of the Law/scribes. (39)
\bttq Why did they praise Jesus?
\tqe The Sadducees did not dare ask Jesus any more questions [because he had shown their ideas to be wrong]. (40)
\an (Note: We assume that these teachers of the Law were not part of the Sadducees, but were part of the Pharisees, who did believe that God raised people to be alive again after dying. They also believed in angels. They often disagreed with the Sadducees about these things. [See Acts 23:6-9].)

\bttq How had David himself described the Christ?
\tqe David had called him his Lord. (42, 44)
\bttq Who were the two Lords whom David wrote about in the Psalm which Jesus quoted? (42)
\tqe The one who spoke was Yahweh, the supreme, eternal God of the Jews.
\tqe The one whom David called "my Lord" was the Messiah, the Christ, whom God had promised to send to save God's people.
\an (Note: Although the two persons are both called by the same name in the Greek and in the English bibles, in the original Hebrew writing, the words are clearly different from each other and do not confuse readers or listeners.)
\bttq What do you think is the answer to Jesus's last question about the Christ being both a descendant of King David and his Lord at the same time? (44)
\tqe The Christ [Jesus] was physically a human descendant in the family line of King David.
\tqe He also was a far greater person than King David because he was God's own son, who had been sent to this earth from heaven.

\bttq Why was the city of Jerusalem going to be totally destroyed?
\tqe It would be time for [God] to punish the people there just like [prophets] had written it would be. (22)
\an (Note: Some of the things which prophets had said would happen you can read in these Old Testament books: Dan. 9:26; 1 Kings 9:6-9; Mic. 3:5-12; Mal. 4:1-2.)

\tqe They may also become frightened when hearing [people talk] about wars and civil unrest. (9)
\bttq What kinds of things would happen later which could also cause people to think that the world was about to end?

\an They would take the believers in front of kings and governors [to be tried in court]. (12)
\bttq Why would those people do like that?

\bttq How does a person "baptize" another?
\tqe [Keep the person's answer in mind.]

\bttq Why do you think that he ate like that?
\tqe It was simple food he could find in the wilderness.
\an (Note: Mark may have told us about John's food and clothing  because it was similar to that of the Old Testament prophets, especially Elijah. [See 2 Kings 1:8.] )
\bttq What did John tell the people about someone whom they would see later on?
\tqe He told them that the one who came after him would be a much greater person than he. (7)
\bttq Why would John not want to do (or, hesitate to do) even very simple work for such a person, like untying his shoes? 
\tqe John understood how great that person was.
\tqe He felt that he himself was not really good enough to be even a servant to him. (7)
\bttq What was the difference between the way John baptized, and the way the person who would come after him would baptize?

\bttq What do you think that the man meant when he said, "Make me clean"?

\bttq Why did the scribes think that Jesus should not say he forgave the paralyzed man's sins?

\tqe and lowered him to the place where Jesus was standing. (4)
\bttq When they did that, what did Jesus realize about them?
\tqe He realized that they had faith (that is, they really believed) that he was able to heal the man. (5)  [Key Term Check: See "faith" in KBT in the "believe" entry.]

\bttq What did Jesus say to the paralyzed man? 
\tqe He said, "I forgive your sins." (5)
\bttq What does a person do when  they forgive another person?
\tqe Key Term Check: They stop thinking about that person as having done something wrong against them. There is no need for the person who did wrong to compensate them, either by receiving punishment or by giving good things in return. (See "forgive" in KBT.)
\an (Note: If the translation has a term for God forgiving people that is different from the term ordinarily used for people forgiving others, check into the reason for this difference. Try switching the verbs for forgiveness and ask what makes each one unacceptable in the people's minds. The Greek text uses the same word in both cases. God expects us to forgive others the same as he has done for us [Mark 11:25; Matt. 6:14-15; 18:32-3; Luke 6:37].)

\tqe He could also see the expression on their faces as he talked.
\bttq Who was Jesus talking about when he mentioned the "Son of Man"? (10)
\tqe He was speaking of himself.
\tqe Key Term Check: "Son of Man" is a title that the prophet Daniel used in Dan. 7:13-14. Daniel was referring to a human figure who is, nevertheless, a heavenly being. God gave him authority to be the leader of God's people on earth. The teachers of the law knew that this title referred to the Messiah. Jesus applied this title to himself. (See "Son of Man" in KBT. ]
\bttq After he said that he forgave the paralyzed man's sins, Jesus indicated to the teachers of the law that they could learn from what he was about to do. What did he expect them to learn?
\tqe He told them that when he forgave the paralyzed man, they did not believe that he really had done that. Now he would heal the man. Then they could know that he was from God, and therefore able both to heal and to forgive sin. (9-10)
\bttq How did the people know that the man was healed?
\tqe They saw him get up and walk away, carrying his mat. (12)
\bttq What did the people think when they saw the man get up and walk away?
\tqe They were amazed and praised (glorified/gave glory to) God. (12)
\tqe Key Term Check: The Greek word translated here as "praised" is the Key Term "glory/glorify". Each meaning of that Greek word tries to describe a characteristic of God that people do not have. In this verse it refers to the best praise, honor, and giving of thanks that anyone can give to God because of his perfect goodness to them. (See "glorify" in KBT in the "glory" entry. ]

\tqe No. (implied in 18-19)
\bttq What did the people ask Jesus?
\tqe They asked him why his disciples did not fast when the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees fasted regularly. (18)
\bttq How did Jesus answer them?
\tqe He answered them by using picture language (that is, he told a story with a hidden meaning). He said that during a wedding festival, friends of the honored man (that is, the bridegroom) would not fast. (19)
\bttq What did Jesus say would happen one day?
\tqe He said that the honored man (bridegroom) would be taken away from them (killed). That is the time when his friends would fast. (19)
\bttq Who do you think that Jesus was talking about when he spoke of  the bridegroom, and his friends?
\tqe He was talking about himself and his disciples being together and later being separated.

\tqe Jesus showed them that his disciples were right to rejoice and not fast (a sign of sorrow) while he was with them.
\bttq Do you think Jesus would care if his disciples fasted if they decided to do that?

\tqe They do not put new wine in an old goatskin [bag/bottle]. (22)
\an (Note: When people seal new wine in a leather container, it will ferment and swell up. An old leather bag is no longer pliable and will break. Both the wine and the bag are ruined.)
\bttq When Jesus spoke about cloth and about the wine and bottle, what was he teaching the people?
\tqe CLOTH-Jesus was teaching that his new teachings cannot be like a patch on the peoples' old system of beliefs. They needed to change their whole approach to God and their belief system.
\an WINE BOTTLE-Pouring some of his teaching into their old non-pliable system was not going to work. They needed to realize that his teaching was new and they needed to follow it all.

\tqref MRK 2.25-26
\bttq Why did Jesus remind them about what their honored ancestor David had done?
\tqe That situation was similar to the disciples picking a bit of food on the rest day. In David's case, he had gone against the law concerning special bread that was kept in the temple. Only priests were allowed to eat that bread. When he and his men arrived at the temple hungry, he had asked the priest, and received from him, some of that special bread. He ate part of it. Then he also gave some to his men to eat(and God did not punish him.) (25-26)
\tqref MRK 2.27-28. 
\bttq What do you think that Jesus was implying about what David and his men had done?
\tqe He was showing that it was all right for them to do that when they were hungry and the special bread was all they could get to eat. 
\bttq What was Jesus teaching the Pharisees? 
\tqe He was teaching them that the rest day was not meant to make people suffer, like going without food. The rest day is to help people. (27)
\bttq The Pharisees had asked why the followers of Jesus were doing work on the Sabbath day and therefore were breaking the laws. How did Jesus answer that question?
\tqe Jesus said that he, the Son of Man, is the boss over the Sabbath day, and therefore knows how to apply the Sabbath day laws. (28)

\rf Mark 3:1-6 Jesus healed a man with a crippled hand. 
\oh Overview
\tqref MRK 3.1-6
\bttq Why did the Pharisees watch Jesus intently after he entered the synagogue?

\bttq Do you think that the man stood up?

\bttq What question did Jesus ask the people who were there?
\tqe He asked them if it was all right to do bad things or to do good things on the rest day. He also asked if it was all right to kill people or to save them from dying on the rest day. (4)
\tqe Key Term Check: See "save" in KBT.
\bttq How did they answer him?
\tqe They did not say anything. (4)
\bttq Why do you think that they did not say anything?
\tqe They knew that they could never say it was all right to do bad or to kill people. They did not want to say it was all right to do good on the Sabbath day, since it would then be all right for Jesus to heal the man that day. They must have thought it best not to say anything.

\bttq How did Jesus show that his power did not come from Satan?

\tqe Key Term Check: A parable shows its meaning indirectly by using picture language to make a comparison. The storyteller generally does not explain the parts of the comparison. The listeners themselves must think about the meaning that the storyteller has hidden in the different parts of his picture language. Jesus taught spiritual truths in this story form. (See "parable" in KBT.)
\bttq What is the difference between Beelzebub and Satan? (22-23)
\tqe They are not two different people. They are just two different names for the same spirit being.
\bttq Why would Satan not drive out evil spirits?
\tqe Groups like families, clans, and governments, do not fight with each other otherwise they would break up. Likewise, Satan would not oppose his own evil spirits and cast them out, or soon he would no longer have any evil spirits to follow him that he could rule over. (26)

\bttq Why did Jesus begin talking about people who speak against the Holy Spirit?
\tqe When those people saw Jesus use the power of the Holy Spirit, but said that Jesus was using the power of Satan, they were speaking (that is, blaspheming) against the Holy Spirit. (29-30)
\bttq What did Jesus say about the punishment for anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit?

\tqe He wanted them to learn that all who do what God wants are like family members to him. (34-35)
\bttq Do you think that Jesus refused to go and talk to his own family?
\tqe Mark did not tell us about that, but only about what Jesus wanted to teach from that situation.

When the crowd mentioned family, Jesus similarly started from that thought and taught about his close relationship to people who obey God. This was the important part that Mark wanted us to know.

\tqe and the birds came and ate it. (4)
\bttq What happened to other seed?

\tqe It came up quickly, but its roots did not develop, so it wilted from the heat of the sun and dried up. (5-6)
\bttq Where did other seed fall?
\tqe Some seed fell where thorny plant/weeds grew.
\tqe These weeds kept the good seed from growing well, so it did not bear anything. (7)

\bttq What happened to the others, those who were not Jesus's followers? 
\tqe They were like some of the Israelite people of Isaiah's time. Isaiah wrote of them that they saw and heard what God was doing, but they did not understand the meaning of it. They did not want to change, and were not seeking God's forgiveness. 
\an (Note: In what Isaiah had written, it was the people's own choice that they did not respond. They were the ones thinking "lest at any time we should turn and be converted." Here in these verses some of the hearers were hostile, so Jesus used parables to help him  proclaim the message without causing them to reject it.)

\bttq How do we know that Jesus was surprised that his followers had not understood the parable?
\tqe He gently rebuked them.

\bttq What do you think that Jesus was teaching here?

\tqe He was talking of  the good news.
\bttq What do you think that Jesus was saying about this good news?
\tqe God's purpose was to make clear to people how he wants to receive them through what Jesus did in dying for them.

\tqref MRK 4.23-25
\bttq What warning did Jesus give here?
\tqe Jesus warned people that they must pay attention to what they hear, so that God will help them to understand more. (23-24)
\bttq What further warning is there in verse 25?
\tqe He warned that people are to understand that if their response to God's good news (of providing forgiveness for their sin and so forth) is inadequate, the little bit they know will not help them any. (25)

\bttq Who do you think the owner really is and what did Jesus mean when he talked about the owner harvesting his crop?
\tqe The owner is God. Jesus meant that God will take those people who become his very own to be with him when the time is right. (29)

\tqe It becomes a large plant with branches big enough for shade for birds.
\tqe -OR-
\tqe    ...with branches big enough for birds to make their nests there. (32)

\bttq What else did Mark tell us about the way that Jesus was teaching people?
\tqe Jesus used only parables. (33-34)

\an (Note: Verse 34 shows that these are other people, not his disciples. Other men besides Mark who wrote about this show that Jesus did this with the crowds.)
\bttq Why did he use only parables with them?
\tqe He used parables because he only taught people as much as they would understand/accept. (33) (Note: They could listen to his parables without being offended. Thinking about these or discussing them with others they could gradually learn more. With their view being so different from what Jesus knew about the kingdom of God and the Messiah his using parables helped to keep them from rejecting him completely and not listening anymore.)

\tqref MRK 5.30-31

\tqe (Check that "power passing from him" does not seem to indicate that his healing of her left him with less power than before.)

\tqref MRK 6.5-6

\bttq Why had Herod given orders for John the Baptist to be put in prison?

\tqe That was the kind of container they thought was best for everyone to see that John was dead. (28)
\an (Note: Check whether village people use the item named in the translation for carrying or holding food. No one was intending to eat John's head. That is not what readers should assume here. The name of a relatively flat, stiff item to carry the head on should be used in the translation instead.)

\oh Overview
\tqref MRK 7.1-23
\bttq What did some of Jesus's disciples do that the Pharisees saw and became upset?
\tqe His disciples ate food without first washing their hands in the proper ritual as their ancestors had said that all Jewish people should do to please God. (2-5)
\bttq What is it that really makes people unclean?
\tqe It is the evil things that they think and do, coming from their own evil nature/desires. (23)
\tqref MRK 7.1-5

\bttq What did the Pharisees want the disciples to do?
\tqe The Pharisees wanted them to clean their hands from a religious uncleanness as their ancestors used to do. (5)  [Key Term Check: unclean/defiled]
\bttq Why do you think that the Pharisees kept thinking that their custom of special washings was so important?
\tqe They believed that  people who did not follow this custom, were doing bad in God's sight. They thought that people had to follow certain rituals to stay clean in order to show that they wanted to obey God's laws.
\tqref MRK 7.6-8
\bttq What did the Pharisees do that caused Jesus to become angry?
\tqe They insisted that people must obey their Jewish customs that their ancestors had made,
\tqe but were not concerned about obeying what God had commanded. (6-8)
\bttq What might a person that speaks this language do that would cause other of his people to call him a hypocrite?
\tqe (Listen for any possible wrong understanding of what Jesus meant here.)
\tqe Key Term Check: hypocrite. Such a person pretends to believe or do what other people will approve of or praise him for. He does not do it because he really believes that what he does is right or good.
\bttq What commands/commandments do you think that the Lord expects people to obey?
\tqe Key Term Check: commandment. The answer should focus on actions like those God named in the Ten Commandments (Exod. 20:1-17; Deut. 5:1-21. It also may include other instructions God gave to his people, as well.]
\bttq Why did Jesus talk about Isaiah?
\tqe Isaiah had written (in the Old Testament) about Jewish people of that time who were just like these Pharisees. Those people acted like they cared for and worked for God, but they really were only concerned with themselves. (6-9)
\tqref MRK 7.9-13
\bttq Will people who read verse 9 think that Jesus was praising the Pharisees?
\tqe He was not praising them. He was angry at what they were doing.
\an (Note: Jesus was using a figure of speech called ‘irony'. That is, he was saying the very opposite of what he meant. When he said, "You have a great way of setting aside God's commandments...," he meant, "You have a very bad way of acting. You ignore God's commands and make up your own rules that do not agree with what God has said.")
\bttq Jesus gave an example to show how the Pharisees were teaching the people wrongly. They were not following God and his teaching like they pretended they were. What were they doing? 
\tqe They said that they were teaching God's laws, while they were actually teaching their Jewish traditions. (9)
\bttq What was the difference between the command that Moses gave them from God and what the Pharisees were saying and doing?
\tqe  Moses had given them a firm command that people should respect and help their parents. 
\tqe  The Pharisees were now telling people that if they ever dedicated things to God as an offering, they could not later change their minds and use those things to help their parents, even though their parents may have no other goods or money. (10-12)
\an -OR- 
\tqe      The Pharisees were now saying that people could avoid giving to their needy parents by making an oath that set aside what they owned as being already dedicated for future offerings to God. (10-12)
\bttq Why was what the Pharisees were doing so bad?
\tqe They were using their own customs and traditions to avoid having to follow God's commandments. (13)
\tqref MRK 7.14-16
\bttq What did Jesus say to all the people?
\tqe He said that we can not be made unacceptable to God by what we eat (like wrong food or some uncleanness) coming into our bodies. Rather, it is the evil actions that start in our own inner thoughts that make us unacceptable to God. (l5-l6)
\tqref MRK 7.17-19
\bttq Did the other people there that day and the disciples understand easily what Jesus was teaching them?
\tqe No. (17)
\bttq According to Jesus's explanation to the disciples, what was he talking about when he mentioned, "the things which are outside of people which enter them"?
\tqe He was talking about food (and any physical or ritual uncleanness) which goes into people's bodies. (18-19)
\bttq What do you think may have made it difficult for the disciples and the others who heard Jesus teach that day to understand that what people eat does not offend God..  
\tqe The Jewish religious leaders emphasized a lot of food and touching restrictions .Jesus's teaching was quite different and they had difficulty understanding that he was actually saying that breaking the many of food and pollution restrictions was not what would offend God. They needed to make a decision as to whether they would follow Jesus or their tradition. He said that their slowness to understand was caused by their hardness of heart. (6:52; 8:14-21)
\tqref MRK 7.20-23 
\bttq What did Jesus mean when he spoke of "the things that come out from a person"?
\tqe He was talking about the bad things we do because of bad desires that come from within us. (20-23)
\bttq Can you name three of the bad actions which Jesus said start in our own thoughts.
\tqe Evil thoughts, greed, slander/insults, sexual immorality, malice/meanness, arrogance/pride, theft/stealing, deceit, folly/foolishness (verse 22) murder, lewdness, adultery  (verse 21) envy

\rf Mark 7:24-30 A woman from a non-Jewish nation begged Jesus to heal her daughter.
\oh Overview
\tqref MRK 7.24-30
\bttq What did the woman who came to Jesus want him to do for her?
\tqe She wanted him to send an evil spirit out of her daughter. (25)
\bttq Why do you think Mark wanted to be sure we knew where this woman came from?
\tqe We need to know that to understand what she and Jesus were talking about. Also people need to know that Jesus helps and receives both Jews and non-Jews. 
\dh Details
\tqref MRK 7.24-26
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus did not want people to know where he was?
\tqe He was trying to have a time of quietness away from the many people. (24)
\bttq Where did Jesus go to get away from all those people?
\tqe He went to the area near [the city of] Tyre [in the Syrian province of Phoenicia]. (24)
\bttq Why do you think that he was not able to stop people from knowing where he was?
\tqe He was not able to remain hidden because he had become well known and people were talking about him [even outside the regions of the Jews]. (24)
\tqref MRK 7.27-28
\bttq Does Jesus's reply sound as if he was agreeing to do what the woman had asked? (27)
\tqe No, he was not agreeing with her. [He implied that she was like a dog compared to the Jews.]
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant when he talked about children and bread and dogs?
\tqe Jesus was saying that he had come to help the "children", the Jews, and that they should be helped first before he helped the "dogs",( which is what Jews sometimes called non-Jews). 
\an (Note: The meaning of what Jesus said here probably will not be easy for people to understood.
\an Points to check: Is it clear that Jesus was using a "proverb" with figurative meaning? If not, is it possible to include some clue to indicate that? Is the fact that the woman was not a Jew shown plainly enough (vss. 24 & 26)? It may be possible to put that in the section heading.)
\bttq How did the woman reply to Jesus?
\tqe She said that even the dogs under the table get some of the crumbs. (28)
\bttq What do you think she meant? 
\tqe She meant that maybe there could be some small amount of help that Jesus could use for a non-Jew, such as her, too. (28)
\tqref MRK 7.29-30
\bttq Does Jesus's answer to the woman sound as if he was angry with her or pleased about her reply?
\tqe He was pleased with her.
\bttq How can you tell that Jesus was pleased with the woman's reply?
\tqe He told her that she could go [because he had answered her request and had sent the demon out of her daughter]. (29)
\bttq Why do you think that Jesus was pleased with the woman's reply?
\tqe It may have been because she persisted in asking for what she wanted. 
\tqe  -OR-… because she clearly believed that he was able to do it. 
\tqe  -OR-…just because it is in God's plan that his gracious blessings should reach to all people groups.
\an (Note: This question is a check for any obvious misunderstanding.)

\bttq Do you think that God wants people to cut off part of their body or gouge out an eye if it causes them to sin?
\tqe No. He does not want that. Jesus was teaching how very serious sin is so people would understand that and not sin. By not sinning, they would avoid God's serious punishment for disobeying him, that punishment being even worse than cutting off part of one's body. (48)

\tqref MRK 10.5-9

\tqe Jesus said that Moses made that rule about writing a divorce notice because of people stubbornly resisting God's [true] way for them. (5)

\bttq What was God's plan for married couples?
\tqe God intended that a man should leave his parents and have a very strong tie with his wife—their special relationship makes them one unit, so people should not separate them. (6-9)

\an (Note: The Jews thought that if a person was rich, that was a sign that God was very pleased with him.)
\bttq Did Jesus say it was impossible for a rich person to become a citizen of God's kingdom?
\tqe No, he said that the love of riches makes it almost impossible for a person to stop trusting the riches and only trust God. (God, of course, can do all kinds of things, including help a rich person understand that God's plan for him is more important than all kinds of riches.) (27)

\tqe They asked that when Jesus had the honor of being king  in God's kingdom he would allow one of them to sit at his right side and the other at his left side (that is, in the seats for the most-honored people, one on each side of him). (37)
\an (Note: In Jewish custom the right hand side of important people was the most honored position anyone could ever have. The left hand side was the next most honored position.)
\bttq Who do you think would decide about the people who will be honored in the kingdom of God?

\bttq What was Jesus trying to make his disciples understand?

\bttq What do you think Jesus meant by his question asking if they would be able to endure being baptized the same as he would endure being baptized? 
\tqe  In this second figure of speech he was not talking about his being baptized. He had already been baptized by John the Baptist a couple of years before this time. He was comparing having many troubles to being totally surrounded by water as when people are  baptized. His meaning here  was  something like, "You want the glory of this leadership position, but have you thought it through? Can you endure the deep sufferings like I will have to endure before taking that position?"

\tqe Anyone who wants to be great among the followers of Jesus must become a servant to all the others, whether they are of high or low social position. (43)
\bttq What did Jesus say about himself?
\tqe He said that he came to serve others, not for them to serve him,
\tqe and he came to exchange his life as a ransom for the lives of the many people.

\tqe They knew that if they said that God had sent John to preach and baptize, then Jesus would ask why they did not believe John the Baptist's message. If, however, they said that it was not God who sent John the Baptist, then the people would turn against them because the people believed that God had chosen John to be one of his prophets. (31-32)
\bttq How did they answer Jesus?
\tqe They said that they did not know whether John the Baptist had God's authority to do what he did or not. (33)
\bttq What did Jesus say to them?

\bttq Why do you think that he built a tower?
\tqe He made a tower so that he could go there and watch for wild animals or birds that might eat or ruin the grapes.(The tower probably provided a place to stay and to store grain as well as a good placed above the vines from which to watch the field.)
\bttq What did the man do when he had finished preparing the vineyard?
\tqe He put it in the care of some people who would rent it,

\tqe They knew that Jesus's story was about them. (12)
\bttq In what way do you think that the parts of the story were about the Jewish leaders?
\an Note: The person who is answering these questions may not know that God used the picture of a vineyard often to refer to the Jews.
\tqe They knew that God often used a vineyard to represent Israel in the Old Testament scriptures. They also knew that they were the ones whom God had put in charge of his people, but they and their ancestors had rejected the prophets whom God had sent, and treated them badly. Jesus was warning that as the owner of his vineyard  God would punish those leaders and get others to watch over his vineyard (his people).
\an (Note: Check that at least the following is communicated: (a) Jesus was speaking with hidden meaning in the illustrations about the vineyard and the stone that the builders rejected. (b) The story was told as a warning to the Jewish leaders, and they had reacted strongly to it.)
\an (The translator could explain in a footnote that the Old Testament writers commonly referred to Israel as God's vineyard.)
\bttq Why were the Jewish leaders afraid of the crowd?
\tqe The Jewish leaders were afraid because they knew that the ordinary people believed that God was with Jesus.
\tqe They knew that the people might rebel against them if they tried to arrest and kill him. (12)

\tqe They answered that it was Caesar (the emperor/king of Rome) whose picture and name was on the coin. (16)
\bttq Then what did Jesus say?
\tqe He said that they should go ahead and serve Caesar with things like that money that were related to him, but at the same time they should serve God (as he requires). (17)

\oh Overview
\tqref MRK 12.18-27
\bttq How did Jesus show that people live on after dying?
\tqe He showed that God refers to some who died as being alive. He said  that even  after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were dead God had said, "I am their God." (So Jesus showed that God knows that when his people's bodies die, their spirits continue to live on with him.) (26-27)

\bttq Tell me the main part of  the story that the Sadducees told to Jesus.
\tqe They said that there were seven brothers, and the first married and died without having any children. (20)
\tqe Then the second brother married that widow and later died, also without having any children. All seven brothers, one after the other, in the same way each married that same woman and each died without having any children. (21-22)
\bttq What did they want Jesus to decide from their story?
\tqe They wanted him to tell them whose wife she would be, when all seven of her husbands were alive again after the resurrection. (23)
\bttq Why do you think that the Sadducees asked that question?
\tqe It was a trick question. They thought that in order to answer it Jesus would have to choose to disagree with God's law that Moses wrote or else agree with them that his own teaching that people live after dying was wrong. 
\tqref MRK 12.24-25
\bttq What was Jesus's attitude toward the Sadducees?

\bttq How did Jesus show that people will rise again from death?

\bttq What were the Sadducees mistaken about?
\tqe They were mistaken when they said that no one lives again after death. (26-27)

\tqe Key Term Check: The Greek word for "love" that is used here means that a person has a gracious, outgoing, active interest in the welfare of another person. John used the same word to explain how much God loves us (John 3:16; 1 John 4:9-11. The translator must explain his reasons if he did not use the same word for love in each of verses 30 and 31. (See "love" in KBT.) ]

\bttq What did the teacher of the law say about Jesus's reply?

\bttq What do you think it means here when it says that from then on no one dared to question Jesus any more?
\tqe What Mark means is that they gave up using trick questions to try to cause Jesus to say something that would make him look foolish to the people. At this time they gave up because each time they questioned him he would give such good answers that the  people would trust him more instead of less.

\bttq What did the teachers of the law say about the Messiah?
\tqe They said that the Messiah  was to be born as a descendant of David. (35)
\bttq Do you think that Jesus agreed with that?

\bttq What did Jesus say that David himself had said about the Christ?

\bttq What is a covenant?
\tqe Key Term Check: A covenant  is an agreement, an especially binding promise. If a person on one side of the covenant does not do as both have agreed, there usually is a strong punishment for him or he pays compensation to the other person. Similar agreements now are called contracts. When  God makes an agreement with people, however, he makes a firm promise of what he will do and says what they must do. [See "covenant" in KBT.]
\tqe  
\tqe (Note: If the language has a special name to refer to these kinds of agreements, ask the assistant to tell you the kinds of situations in which the people make the agreements. Listen for any points where it would not be appropriate to state that God made that kind of an agreement. Then adjust the translation as necessary.)

If it sounds very similar to "Abba," only use the vernacular word. If the two words sound somewhat different from each other, transliterate Jesus's own word "Abba" and use the local word in addition as the translation of the Greek word for "[My] Father".)

\tqe This refers to him being equal to or next in authority with God. (62)
\an (Note: In Jewish custom the right hand side of important people was the most honored position anyone could ever have. Therefore, this figure fits well and shows that Jesus now is there next to God, sharing in what God does.)

\tqe Jesus had openly claimed that he was the Son of God, and they all had heard him say it. (62)

\tqe Jesus, counting through Joseph's ancestors, was a descendant/descendent of David; and David was a descendent of Abraham. (1)
\an (Note: With this question, the checker/consultant can find out whether the translation suggests that Jesus was the immediate son of David and that David was the immediate son of Abraham.)
\bttq What do you think is the meaning of "Christ" in this verse?
\tqe Key Term Check: In this verse "Christ" is used as a name. (See "Christ" in KBT.)
\bttq Who was Isaac's father?
\tqe Isaac's father was Abraham. (2)
\bttq Who was Isaac's son?
\tqe Isaac's son was Jacob. (2)
\bttq If you were writing or explaining about different generations of people, which of these two explanations would you be more likely to use in order to make it sound more natural to the reader? 1. Would you explain/write about Isaac being the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah? or 2.Would you explain the difference by writing/saying Isaac bore Jacob, and Jacob bore Judah?
\an (Note: This is a test for naturalness.)
\bttq When people read verse 16, is it clear to them/can they tell who was Jesus's mother?
\tqe Yes. It was Mary who gave birth to him. (16)
\bttq When people read verse 16, what will they understand about Joseph?
\tqe They will understand that he was Mary's husband. (16)
\an (Note: Matthew was careful not to imply that Joseph was the true father of Jesus.)
\bttq What does the linking word or words that join verse 17 to the earlier verses mean?
\tqe The link back to the earlier verses should show that all the ancestors/generations, mentioned in this account, are fourteen in each section/case. That is, between Abraham and David, between David and the deportation to Babylon, and again between the deportation and the birth of the Christ/Messiah, there are fourteen generations listed.
\an (Note: Genealogies did not have to mention every generation/all of the actual generations to be a valid proof of a person's lineage; and this one does not show all of the generations in each set. Some had more than the fourteen listed here.)
\bttq What do you think is the meaning of the Christ in 1:17?
\tqe Key Term Check: "Christ" is the English rendering of the Greek word Christos, which means "God's anointed one." (See "Christ" in KBT.)

\dh Details
\tqref MAT 1.18-19
\bttq What is the reason that Joseph decided not to take Mary as his wife?
\tqe He decided not to take Mary as his wife because he found out that she had become pregnant. (18)
\bttq What sort of person does the text/the Scripture say Joseph was?
\tqe He was a righteous person—one who did what was right. (19)
\bttq What is the reason that Joseph wanted to break off the planned marriage privately?
\tqe He wanted to break off the planned marriage so that he would not cause problems for Mary, such as causing her to be embarrassed. (19)
\tqref MAT 1.20-21
\bttq In his dream what did an/the angel tell Joseph?
\tqe The angel told Joseph not to be concerned, but to go ahead and take Mary home as his wife because she was pregnant by/from the Holy Spirit. She had not been unfaithful to Joseph. (20)
\bttq What do you know about angels?
\tqe Key Term Check: Angels are spiritual messengers, who either deliver a message to humans, carry out God's will, praise God, or guard God's throne. (See "angel" in KBT.)
\bttq What did the angel tell Joseph about the child that Mary was carrying?
\tqe The angel told him that it would be a boy, and that Joseph should name him Jesus, (which meant "Savior"). He was to name him that because he would save his people from their sins. (21)
\bttq What does it mean to "save people from their sin"?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that Jesus/He saves people from remaining guilty in God's sight, and so from receiving the punishment they would otherwise receive because of their sin. (See "save" in KBT.)
\an (Note: This is a check for any wrong meaning.)
\bttq What does a person do when he sins?

\bttq Who had said that a virgin would be/become pregnant and would have/bear a son whom people would call Emmanuel?
\tqe An Old Testament prophet had said/written that. (22-23)
\bttq What do you know about prophets?
\tqe Key Term Check: A prophet is someone who speaks for God because God inspires him. He often foretells future events. Prophets were mainly spokespersons who called/challenged His people to obey/obedience by appealing to Israel's past and future. (See "prophet" in KBT.)
\bttq What does the name Emmanuel mean?
\tqe Emmanuel means "God is with us". (23)
\bttq When Matthew wrote this name, Emmanuel, and its meaning, what do you think he wanted us to understand about Jesus?
\tqe Matthew wanted us to understand that, because Jesus was/is the Son of God, he is/was not an ordinary man. He is himself God.
\bttq Who do you think God is?
\tqe Key Term Check: He is the supreme being whom people should worship. In English, the term "God" with a capital "g" is used to refer to the one supreme Creator. The term "god" with a small "g", as in "a god" or "many gods", can refer to any spiritual being whom people worship. The Greek word theos can be used in the same two ways.
\an In many languages the term for God is a proper name and cannot be used to refer to anyone except the one supreme creator of the world. It cannot be pluralized. (Or, if it can be pluralized, the meaning may be something very different from the English "gods".) (See "God" in KBT.)
\tqref MAT 1.24-25
\bttq What did Joseph do after the angel told him that Mary had been faithful to him, and explained how she had become/it was that she was pregnant?

\tqe Jesus was born in the Roman province of Judea. (1)

(See "Jew" in KBT in the "Israel" entry.)
\tqref MAT 2.3-6
\bttq What caused Herod to be worried?
\tqe When Herod heard that the king of the Jews had been born, he was worried that this Jewish boy might cause the Jews to reject him, since he was a Roman king who was ruling over them. (3)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that the people of Jerusalem were also disturbed?
\tqe They also were afraid because they knew that, if the Roman government leaders began thinking that the Jews were preparing to choose/have their own king, the Romans would send their soldiers to punish the Jews.
\an (Note: This is a check for wrong meaning.)
\bttq What is the reason that Herod called together the chief priests and scribes?
\tqe He called them together in order to ask them where that/this important leader, who was referred to as Messiah by the prophets in the Old Testament, was to be born. (4)
\bttq What do you know about the chief priests?
\tqe Key Term Check: The chief priests were the leaders among the priests at the temple in Jerusalem. They decided everything that had to do with the worship of God and with the use of the temple grounds. (See "chief priest" in KBT.)

\an They would know from reading what the prophets had written in (Old Testament) scripture. (5)
\an (See Micah 5:2.)

\tqe He had prophesied saying that Bethlehem village, though a small place, was actually an important place in the land of Judah, since a ruler from that village would lead Israel someday. (6)
\bttq What do you know about the name "Israel"?
\tqe Key Term Check: In the New Testament, the terms "Israel" and "Israelite" are used by Jews to refer to themselves. Those terms were also used by God to refer to them as his people. (See "Israel" in KBT.)

\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 2.13-18
\bttq Where did Joseph take Jesus and Mary?
\tqe He took them to Egypt. (14)
\dh Details
\bttq What is the reason that Joseph took Jesus and Mary to Egypt?
\tqe He took them to Egypt because an angel had appeared to him in a dream and told him to do that, before Herod's soldiers/men could find and kill Jesus. (13-14)
\bttq In verses 14 and 15 Matthew wrote/it says that they went and stayed in Egypt, until Herod died, and that what they did fulfilled what a prophet had written in the Old Testament. That prophet had written, "I called my son out of Egypt." How do you think this event fulfilled that prophecy/writing/saying? (See also verses 19 and 20.)
\tqe This was the time that God's son went to Egypt, so that later he could be called out of Egypt, as Matthew wrote in verses 19-20.
\an (Note: The translation may need to mention that this action by Joseph was a fulfillment of the statement "I called my son out of Egypt.")
\bttq What did Herod do when he realized that the Magi had not come back to report where they found the child, as he had asked them to do?
\tqe He sent his men/soldiers to Bethlehem to kill all of the boys two years old and younger that lived anywhere near Bethlehem. (16)
\bttq How did killing the Bethlehem children like that fulfill what the prophet Jeremiah had said/written in a kind of poetry which is quoted here in verse l8?
\tqe Ramah refers to a place near Bethlehem.
\tqe Rachel refers to Isaac's wife who is/was viewed as the ancestral mother of the nation of Israel.
\an (Note: The introduction to the Old Testament quote/quotation in the translation here may need to state that the prophet said/wrote this about a place in the Bethlehem area. The original readers would have known that Ramah and Bethlehem were (located in) the same area.)
\an (Also note: Rachel, who died many, many years before this was written, was buried in that area. Since she (being Isaac's wife) was viewed as the mother of all Jewish people, she is described in this poetry as crying for the children. However, it is her Jewish descendants many generations later, who lived in that area, who actually wept. In the translation of this fulfillment it may be necessary to speak of the descendants of Rachel mourning and weeping for their children just as Rachel had mourned long ago. You will probably want to keep the Old Testament context of the quote/quotation in mind, too, as you work on this.)

\rf Matthew 2:19-23 Joseph, Mary and Jesus returned from Egypt.
\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 2.19-23
\bttq What is the reason that Joseph decided to return to his homeland?

\dh Details
\bttq What did Joseph do when he realized that Archelaus was the new king over Judea district?
\tqe He took his family and went to live at/in Nazareth in the Galilee district. (22-23)

\bttq What did John the Baptist do?
\tqe He told the people that there was a much more important person among them, whom they should follow, namely Jesus. He told them all to repent and obey God, since the time when God would rule them was near. (1-12)

\tqref MAT 3.1-3
\bttq What do you think Matthew meant when he wrote that John the Baptist "came" or "appeared"?
\tqe He did not mean that John came to a certain place, but that he came into the public view, that is, he appeared on the scene, doing a public ministry. (1)
\bttq From what Matthew wrote, when do you think he "came," [or "appeared"]?
\tqe The words of verse 1, "In those days", refers to the time while Jesus still lived at Nazareth. (1)
\an (Note: We know that these events mentioned here in this text occurred many years after Jesus started living at Nazareth. At that time Jesus and John would have both been about 30 years old.)
\bttq John the Baptist told people to repent in verse 2. What do you think it means when someone repents?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that the person regrets his sins and unbelief, turns from them and follows God. (See "repent" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think John meant when he said that the kingdom of heaven was near?
\tqe Key Term Check: The English word kingdom is used here in its nearly obsolete meaning of kingship. It refers to the fact of God's ruling in people's lives rather than referring to the area of the earth over which he rules. The meaning here is that the King [that is, Jesus,] was near, that the time when God will rule over people (in a special way) was to occur soon. (See "kingdom of heaven" in KBT.)

\bttq How can we tell?
\tqe Matthew wrote that people from the whole surrounding area went to hear/and heard John's teaching. They confessed their sins, and he baptized them. (5-6)
\tqref MAT 3.7-10
\bttq What do you think was the reason that John was not glad that the Pharisees and Sadducees came to him to be baptized?
\tqe He was not glad because he knew that they did not come wanting/in pursuit of a right relationship with God. They were just acting as though they agreed with John's teaching about repenting and worshipping God so that others would think well of them. (7-10)
\bttq What do you know about Pharisees?
\tqe Key Term Check: The Pharisees were the largest and most important of the Jewish religious groups. They controlled the synagogues and exercised great control over the general population.

\tqe He meant that they needed to really change their attitude toward God and show it by their actions. (8)
\bttq What was wrong with considering themselves the descendants of Abraham when they really were his descendants?

\bttq What do you think John meant when he said that God could make stones into children for/of Abraham if he wanted?
\tqe He was saying that, if God needed children for/of Abraham, he could easily do it by making them from stones. (9)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that John talked about cutting down trees that did not bear good fruit?
\tqe John was showing that God wanted people who will truly serve him. He will treat those who will not serve him as/in the same manner that men do their fruit trees that do not produce good fruit. They cut them down and burn them. (Context of 7-10 and broader NT context.)
\tqref MAT 3.11-12
\bttq Who do you think was the one who would soon appear?
\tqe Jesus was the one who would soon appear. (11)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that John might have felt that he was unfit to even carry (or untie) Jesus's sandals?
\tqe He might have felt that way because he knew who Jesus was. He felt unworthy to do anything for Jesus. (11)
\bttq What did John think about his water baptism as compared to Jesus's kind of baptism?
\tqe John showed that he knew Jesus's baptism was more important/much greater. (11)

\tqe Key Term Check: "Baptism" is the outward sign by which a person's commitment to and union with Jesus Christ are publicly demonstrated. (See "baptize" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think John was talking about when he mentioned that Jesus would baptize people with the Holy Spirit?
\tqe He was talking about Jesus sending the Holy Spirit to be with his people. (11)
\an (Note: The change that the Holy Spirit would bring in people's lives would, like water baptism, be a sign to other people that they were now following God.)
\bttq When John said that Jesus would "baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire", what do you think he meant by "fire"? (This is a check for any obviously wrong meaning.)
\tqe There are different possible interpretations of what John meant.
\tqe In the Bible:
\tqe  1) Fire is used figuratively to indicate purification, since fire is sometimes used to burn up less costly and less permanent elements, while leaving the valuable elements unharmed. This purification figure is commonly applied/used to apply to Christians in the New Testament.
\tqe  2) Fire is used to indicate punishment/judgment from God by association with the pain of burning. Such punishment/judgment would usually apply to non-believers in the New Testament.
\an (Note: From John's concern that, at least some of them, might depend on their status of being descendants of Abraham and miss God's blessing, he could be referring to some of them as being baptized with the Holy Spirit and others being baptized with fire. This would then make fire here mean about the same as in verses 10 and 12, where it means judgment/punishment.)
\bttq While he was speaking to the Pharisees and Sadducees, what do you think is the reason that John talked about God winnowing everything on his threshing floor—saving the wheat and burning the chaff?
\an He was telling them to truly repent and to change their actions, so that they would not be punished.
\bttq What kind of fire did John say God would use to burn up the chaff/unusable part?
\tqe God would use fire that could not be extinguished/put out. (12)

\tqe He taught them about being angry with others.
\dh Details
\bttq What was the usual teaching about murder that everyone had heard before Jesus talked to them that day?

\tqe He said that we should not be angry with a brother nor should we call him bad/evil names like "Wicked fool." (22)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant when he mentioned/said brother in verse 22?
\tqe Key Term Check: In this verse Jesus meant that a brother was anyone who was a fellow-believer in Jesus. (See "brother" in KBT in the "disciple" entry.) (Also see comments from the UBS handbook on "brother" in this verse.)
\bttq What should a person do who was/is angry with someone?
\tqe Jesus said that he should first be reunited with people. Then God could forgive him when he presented his (burnt) offering to him. (23-24)

\tqe Key Term Check: Two people are reconciled to each other, when one individual or the other takes the initiative to settle the quarrel between them, so that they are no longer enemies, but friends. (See "reconcile" in KBT.)
\bttq In verse 25, Jesus did not say to whom he was referring when he spoke of their opponent. Whom do you think he meant?

\bttq Who else could this opponent be?
\an This opponent could be God himself.
\an (Note: Jesus was teaching about our relationship with God, so he was not suddenly switching to speaking of/talking about avoiding people in the local court here at the end of this section. Rather, he is using figurative language to make a strong rhetorical point. He is saying, "Do not be in a wrong relationship with God, lest you find yourself in court with him and not be able to satisfy the penalty for your wrong doing." Emphasizing the inability to pay the penalty may help to make this point clearer in the translation.)

\rf Matthew 5:27-30 Jesus taught about the "Do not commit adultery" law.

\bttq About what did Jesus teach the people in these verses?
\tqe He taught them about not committing adultery.
\dh Details
\bttq What was the usual understanding of the law about adultery in the days when Jesus was teaching?
\tqe The people understood that law to mean that people must not commit adultery. (27)
\bttq What do you think it means to commit adultery with another person?
\tqe Key Term Check: Adultery is the act of unfaithfulness in marriage that occurs when one of the marriage partners voluntarily engages in sexual intercourse with a person of the opposite sex other than his or her marriage partner.
\bttq What more did Jesus teach about this?
\tqe He taught that this also means that a person/we must not look at someone/people of the opposite sex to lust after them, because that is committing adultery with that person/them in our thoughts. (28)
\bttq Did Jesus mean in verses 29 & 30 for someone/a person to gouge out his or her/their eye, or to cut off his or her/their arm, if he or she/they had used those parts of their bodies to sin?
\tqe No, he did not mean that.
\bttq What did he mean?
\tqe Jesus again is using rhetoric that his hearers would have understood. He meant for us to think how very serious sin is and to stop doing it. (In fact, gouging out one eye would not help much, since there would still be an eye left. The same is true of cutting off an arm.) Thinking how serious sin really is, though, should help a person to obey God, so that he can help that person.

\bttq What did Jesus say about that?
\tqe He said that people should not make those promises such as saying, "As sure as heaven…", or, "As sure as God's throne, … I will do such and such." If a person is honest, he should be able to just say "yes" or "no" and let that be enough for his hearers, without adding other promises. (34-37)
\bttq What is the reason that Jesus did not want them to make those kinds of promises?
\tqe Jesus said that they should tell the truth. Lies are caused by Satan. (37)

\bttq Did Jesus think that people should insist on punishing another person when that person did wrong to them?

\bttq What did Jesus say that his disciples should do?
\tqe He said that they should love their enemies and pray for the ones who persecuted them. (44)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus said that loving their enemies would make them sons of their father in heaven?
\tqe Loving their enemies would not make them into children of God, but it would demonstrate to others that they were children of God. The people to whom he was talking here were already related to God, as we can tell by the fact that he called God their Father. The terms "son of" and "daughters of," in that culture, were often used to mean "a typical representative of." Compare the term "daughters of Jerusalem" which they used to talk about typical women of Jerusalem. (45)

\tqe Jesus expected his disciples to greet people who were not of their group, and love people other than those who loved them. (46-47)
\bttq In verse 48, what is it that Jesus wants believers/his followers to do?

\bttq What is a proper way to give?
\tqe A good way is to give without letting others know that you have given. (3-4)

\tqe He wanted to warn his hearers not to be like hypocrites. (5-8)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant when he said that the hypocrites had already received all of their reward for praying?
\tqe He meant that, since they were not really praying to God, God would not send them blessing/would not help them because of those prayers. The only help they receive is when people praise them. // The only advantage they would receive for having said the prayers publicly, would be the praises of people. (5-6)
\bttq Should our prayers be long, short, or what, according to verses 7 and 8?
\tqe We should not try to make our prayers long with meaningless words and phrases or a lot of repetition. Our prayers do not need to be long, since God already knows what we need before we ask. (7-8)
\bttq Do you think Jesus meant that the prayer he suggested/suggested prayer he gave is the only way to pray?
\tqe No. He showed/taught them an example.

\tqe Their goal should be for people here on earth to obey God fully, as the heavenly beings/angels already obey him. (10)
\bttq What did he recommend that his disciples ask concerning their own needs?
\tqe They should ask that God would supply their need for each day as it approached. (11)
\bttq What did Jesus show in his prayer as an appropriate way for his disciples to ask God to forgive them?
\tqe They could ask God to forgive the wrong they did as they themselves were forgiving the wrong others did to them. (12)
\bttq What do you think happens when a person/someone forgives someone else?
\tqe Key Term Check: Forgiveness always involves two people, one of whom has done something wrong to the other and offended him. Forgiveness takes place when the one, who was offended, sets aside his right to justice and decides not to punish the offender, as he deserved. If the one who offended repents and accepts this forgiveness, the result is that the relationship between the two, which was broken by the offense, is restored and the guilt of the offender is removed. (See "forgive" in KBT.)
\bttq What did Jesus suggest as one appropriate way to pray so that God would keep them from sinning?
\tqe They could ask God to protect them from being tempted (beyond what they could withstand) and thus God would rescue them from evil/the evil one. (13)
\bttq Who do you think the evil one is?
\tqe Key Term Check: The "evil one" is another name for Satan. (See "evil one" in KBT in the "Satan" entry.)

\dh Details
\bttq What do you think is the reason that some people would try to go around looking sad when they fasted?
\tqe Some people went around looking sad in order to show/to demonstrate to others that they were fasting. They wanted other people to think that they were good/religious/holy people. (16)
\bttq Would God be pleased with people who fasted just to make other people think that they were seriously worshipping God?
\tqe No. That would not make God happy.
\bttq What gain did Jesus say such people earn/achieve from fasting like that?
\tqe He said that the only thing they would gain from such fasting would be the attention of those other people. (16)
\bttq What should we do then, if we decide to fast?
\tqe We should dress and wash ourselves as usual, so that only God knows that we are fasting.
\tqe Since God knows everything, he will know what we are doing and can bless us. (17-18)

\bttq What do you think Jesus meant by earthly treasure?
\tqe He meant anything on earth that people value and which might distract them from maintaining/continuing their relationship with God.

\tqe The things that people/we value here on earth are not long lasting, and they will tend to distract people/us from the/our lifetime goal of loving and serving God. (20-21)
\bttq What is the purpose of our eyes?
\tqe We see with our eyes and they show the rest of the body the way we want/the person wants to go. (22)
\bttq What, then, is the difference between a good eye and a bad eye for the body?
\tqe With a good eye the person can see where he wants to go. If our/a person's eye is bad, we/he cannot see where he wants/we want to go. (22-23)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant when he spoke of a person having a "good eye" and when he spoke of a person having a "bad eye"?
\tqe A person who can see is like a person who has a heart to know God. A person who can not see is like a person who has a heart not to know God and not to do his will.
\bttq What did Jesus say about a person trying to serve two masters?
\tqe Jesus said that if a person tries to serve two masters, he will always have more devotion for one master than for the other. Therefore, by neglecting one of the two masters, he will not be serving that one at all. (24)

\tqe Having a body and being alive we have the opportunity to have a true/proper/genuine relationship with God.

\bttq Who values us as more important than birds?
\tqe God values us as more important than the birds. (26)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus asked them the question about who could live longer/add more days to their life by worrying?
\an Ask this question only if verse 27 is in a question form after being translated.
\tqe He was not asking in order to learn something from them. He was using a question to emphasize to them that worrying does not help anyone/does no good.

\tqe God will take care of them. (33)
\an (Note: This is implied.)
\bttq If the translation still says so, then ask: How can a day actually be able to think enough to worry?

\bttq About whom do you think Jesus was speaking when he spoke of "the Son of Man" in verse 20?
\tqe Key Term Check: Jesus was speaking about himself. "Son of Man" is a title/one of the titles Christ used of Himself. (See "son of man" in KBT.)
\bttq What did Jesus mean when he said that he had no place to lay his head?
\tqe He meant that the man, who asked, might not be happy staying with him, since he had no home of his own, but/and moved from place to place. (20)

\bttq What did Jesus mean when he said to let dead people bury their own dead people?
\tqe He meant that people who did not truly follow God, could attend to their parents and eventually bury them when they died.

\an They refused to believe God's son when he was right there with them.
\bttq If the translated text uses a question for what Jesus says in verse 4 and/or verse 5 then ask: Do you think Jesus expected the people to answer his question(s)?
\an No, he did not.
\an (Note: He asked those question(s) to make them start thinking. In verse 4 he was simply saying, with emphasis, that they should not think as they were. They should be willing to accept Jesus as one sent from God.)
\bttq What do you think about verse 5? What was Jesus telling them by asking which was easier to say, "I forgive your sins." or "Get up and walk"? It wasn't that one phrase was easier to say than the other phrase. Jesus demonstrated that he had power from God to heal the man. Therefore he had power to forgive sin.

\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 9.9-13
\bttq What kind of work did Matthew do before Jesus called him to follow him?
\tqe He was a tax collector. (9)
\an (Note: The Jews thought that tax collectors were dishonest people because many of them charged/collected/took more tax than the government required, then kept the extra money for themselves. Also, people did not like them because they collected for the Roman government, which had occupied/taken over Israel by force.)
\dh Details
\bttq What did the Pharisees think about Jesus eating with tax collectors and others, whom the Pharisees called sinners?
\tqe They thought that Jesus should not eat with them. (10-11)
\bttq What is the reason that Jesus thought it was all right for him to mix with such people?
\tqe Jesus's idea was that, if people were bad, they needed help from God. (He referred to them as sick people needing a doctor.) (12)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that, right in the middle of this/his talk/teaching about his eating with sinners, Jesus talked about mercy being better than making sacrifices?
\tqe Jesus talked about the/our need to be merciful to others, at that time, because the Pharisees were proud of doing all of the culturally right religious acts; but they were not kind to other people, including the sinners in their midst. Also they were trying to stop Jesus from being kind to those sinners. (Their religious acts included sacrificing animals.) (13)
\bttq What do you think it means for someone to show mercy to someone else?
\tqe Key Term Check: "Mercy" in the New Testament is an act of kindness by God or by a person 
\an to/toward someone else. (See "mercy" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think it means when someone makes a sacrifice?

The gift is given in order to establish, maintain, or restore a proper relationship between the sacrificer and the deity. Something is given up in order to achieve a purpose. (See "sacrifice" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus told them that he came to call sinners and not righteous people?
\tqe He said that because he came to help people who were not in/did not have a right relationship with God. (Also probably because the scribes and Pharisees (who were talking to him) called themselves "righteous people." They would not admit their need or come to ask him to forgive their sins.) (13)
\bttq What did Jesus want the scribes and Pharisees to learn?
\tqe He wanted them to learn that God wants them to have compassion on others, rather than giving gifts to him. (13)

\dh Details
\tqref MAT 9.14-15
\bttq When Jesus answered their question, what do you think is the reason that Jesus told them about/talked about what friends of a bridegroom would do?
\tqe Jesus compared his disciples to the friends of a bridegroom who are happy to be with the bridegroom. They would not refuse to eat (which was a sign of sorrow), when the bridegroom was there with them. (15)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus mentioned the bridegroom being taken away from his friends?
\tqe He was telling them what would happen to him. He used the figure of a bridegroom to refer to himself. Then he explained to/told them that there would be a reason for his disciples to fast when he was taken away from them. (15)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus had taught his disciples about when to fast and when not to fast?
\tqe Probably he had taught them not to just follow traditions without thinking about what they were doing. They should fast when there was a reason to fast. (15)
\tqref MAT 9.16-17

\tqe He said that people do not repair an old garment with a piece of new cloth. (16)

\bttq What was the second thing Jesus said people do not do?
\tqe He said that they did not put new wine in an old goatskin (old leather bottle). (17)
\an (Note: Check that the point of the illustration itself is clear. When someone seals new wine in a non-pliable leather container, the wine will swell while fermenting. That will cause the container to break and result in a total loss of the contents/wine.)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus spoke here about cloth, and about the wine and about hardened leather containers/bottles? What was he teaching the people?
\tqe He taught them that his teachings could not be a part of their old teachings/traditions/traditional system. They needed to change what they believed and also to change their way of worshipping God. (16-17)

\bttq What is the reason that the crowd laughed at Jesus?
\tqe They laughed because he said that the girl was not dead, but (only) asleep. They knew she was dead. (24)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus (might have) said that the girl was sleeping when she was (really/already) dead?
\tqe He knew her condition was temporary, since he was at the point of bringing/about to bring her back to life. (24)
\bttq What did Jesus do then?

\bttq Who made the demon leave the man so that he was able to speak again?
\tqe Jesus did. (This is implied from the reason they gave for bringing the man to Jesus. It is also implied by/as the cause of the Pharisees false complaint against Jesus in verse 34.)
\bttq What did the crowd of people think when Jesus did that?
\tqe They were amazed at the miracles Jesus was doing in their land. (33)
\bttq By the miracles that Jesus did, were the Pharisees convinced that Jesus was the Messiah?

\tqe They were not to take money, no bag [for carrying food], nor were they to take/carry an extra outer garment or sandals or walking stick. (9-10)
\bttq What is the reason that they were not to take such things with them?

\tqe They were to realize that the greeting of God's peace, or "God will help you live well," was not the correct message for those people.

\bttq What do you think Jesus meant when he talked about sheep and wolves and about the disciples needing to be, in some ways, like snakes and doves?
\tqe He meant that some of the people, that they would see, would be (just) waiting to harm them. So for that reason they needed to have a good plan of action to escape danger. Snakes were viewed as having that ability, but they were not to harm anyone, just as doves do not harm anyone. (16)
\bttq What is the reason that he told the disciples to watch out/be careful, and to have only good motives?
\tqe They were to be careful because people would bring them before the local Jewish council meeting in the synagogue and have them beaten. (17)
\bttq What is the reason that people would take them to the courts of kings and governors?
\tqe They would be representing Jesus, so people who were hostile to Jesus would take them to court. (18)
\bttq What would happen when they were in court before the Kings?
\tqe Kings, governors and people of the various nations would hear their testimony about Jesus as they spoke in court. (18)
\bttq What is the reason that they should not worry about what to say if they were (being) brought to court for serving Jesus?
\tqe They were not to be worried about what to say in the court session because God's spirit would help them to know what to say to the leaders/officials as they were in the act of speaking. (19-20)

\tqe Because family members, who did not love or believe/follow Jesus, would be so very much against those who believed/followed him that they would accuse them before leaders to have them killed. Local leaders had called Jesus, Beelzebub, that is Satan, so of course they would not like his believers/people/followers either. The believers/his people/followers needed to be ready to be rejected. (21-25)
\bttq What do you think that Jesus meant when he said "brother" in verse 21?
\tqe Key Term Check: In this verse, Jesus meant brother to be someone who is a biological brother.

\tqe They were not to fear because God would judge those leaders for whatever they did to them, when/at the time he judges all people. He might even judge them before that final judgment day. (26)
\bttq About what was Jesus talking when he mentioned his speaking to them "in the dark" and "whispering in their ears"?
\tqe He was referring to what he said to them privately. (27)
\bttq About what was he talking when he referred to their "speaking in the daylight" and "proclaiming from the house tops"?
\tqe He was saying that they needed to proclaim the message, that/which he had taught them privately, to the people publicly/out among the people so that everyone would hear it. (27)
\bttq Do you think Jesus thought that would be a dangerous thing for them to do?
\tqe Yes, he did.
\bttq Why?
\tqe Because after he told them to proclaim the message, he told them again not to fear people who could only kill a person's body. (27-28)
\bttq Whom did he say they should fear?
\tqe They should rather be afraid to forsake/offend the one who can cause people to die, as well as cause them to be punished in hell. (28)
\bttq Who do you think that is?
\tqe He was speaking/talking about God. (The one who can send people to hell for punishment/to be punished.)
\bttq What do you know about hell?
\tqe Key Term Check: It is a place where those who have rejected the Lord will spend eternity. It is a place where there is constant pain and darkness. (See "hell" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus started speaking of/talking about sparrows?
\tqe He mentioned sparrows because he wanted them to know that God, who watches over rather insignificant parts of his creation, like sparrows, will certainly watch over his people. (29-31)
\bttq Who knows the number of the hair on our heads?
\tqe God does/knows. (This is implied.) (30)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus mentioned that fact here?
\tqe He was showing that, if God knows these details, then he can take care of/protect us even down to each hair. We do not need to be afraid. (30-31)
\tqref MAT 10.32-33
\bttq After talking about how they should not be afraid of people, what was Jesus trying to make plain to his disciples in verses 32 and 33?
\tqe They needed to acknowledge/confess/admit to being his people, so that he could state to the Father that they were his people. (32-33)
\tqref MAT 10.34-36
\bttq People who lived at the time Jesus was here on earth were thinking that the Messiah's (Christ's) kingdom would bring peace on the earth. Did Jesus say that would happen since he had come?
\tqe No. He said that his having come would cause strife. (34)
\bttq What do you think it means to be at peace?
\tqe Key Term Check: To be at peace is to have a mental or spiritual condition marked by freedom from disquieting or oppressive thoughts or emotions.
\bttq About what sort of strife was Jesus talking?
\tqe He said that people who were of the same household would be against one another [because some would choose to believe/follow him and the others would hate them]. (35-36)
\tqref MAT 10.37-39
\bttq In such a case will it be all right with Jesus for people to do as their relatives do, who will have nothing to do with Jesus, to keep peace in the family?
\tqe No, it will not be all right.
\bttq Why will it not be all right?
\tqe It will not be all right because Jesus said that, if people cared more for their family than for him, then they were not worthy of being one of his people/counted as his. (37)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant in verse 38, when he said people needed to carry their cross and follow him?
\tqe Key Term Check: Jesus meant that people, who wanted to follow him, needed to be willing to die in order to be a faithful follower of his/him. (See "cross" in KBT.)
\bttq What did Jesus mean by what he said in verse 39?
\tqe People who try to save themselves from any troubles or from death by not obeying him will lose their chance to have life eternal. Those who are willing to die on earth in order to follow him will have life eternal. (39)
\tqref MAT 10.40-42
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant by the word "receive" when he said, "whoever receives you receives me"?
\tqe It is a bit difficult to know if the first reference here is to receiving them into their homes, or if Jesus is now referring mostly to people receiving rather than rejecting them and their message. However, those who would receive them because they are Jesus's disciples, would almost certainly receive them in all the above manners/ways. (40-42)
\bttq Jesus said that when they receive his disciples, they are at the same time receiving him and also the one who sent him. Whom do you think people, who read the translation, will think Jesus meant when he said, "the one who sent me"?
\tqe They should understand that Jesus meant God his father. (Implied) (40)
\bttq How will Jesus reward those who are good to people who serve God?
\tqe He will reward them in the same manner that he will reward those servants of his whom they help. (41)
\bttq Will God notice even rather insignificant help to his newest followers by rewarding the one who helped them?
\tqe Yes, he will notice. Even down to a drink of water. (42)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that God rewards such people?
\tqe He will reward them because they are the ones who truly follow him. (40)
\an (Note: This answer comes from the context and draws the passage together somewhat, but would be difficult to elicit/obtain from a respondent to these questions, who was reading the passage for the first time (the ideal kind). See especially verses 13 and l4 and verse 40. Jesus's coming caused people to make a choice for or against him as seen in verse 34 and following/and subsequent verses/onward.)

\bttq How did Jesus answer John's question when he sent his reply?

\bttq What do you think most people, who read verse 7, would think Jesus meant when he asked if they had gone out to see a reed bent back and forth by the wind?
\tqe In Jesus's question he was asking them if they had found John to be an easily influenced person who was like a tall thin reed that bends different ways according to which way the wind was blowing/coming. (7)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus asked if they had gone out to see someone in fine clothes?
\tqe He probably asked that because their other religious leaders wore fine clothes, but John was different. (8)
\bttq In verse 9, what do you think Jesus meant when he said that John was a prophet and more than a prophet?
\tqe He meant that John was truly a prophet; but he was not just a prophet, he was a special prophet. (9)
\bttq In verse 10, who do you think spoke, and to whom was he speaking?
\tqe It is clear from the Old Testament and the way the Old Testament quotation/quote is used here that it was God speaking to his son, the Messiah. (10)
\bttq What can we learn from that Old Testament quotation given here in verse 10? What was so special about John that Jesus said he was "more than a prophet"?
\tqe From the Old Testament/this quotation we learn that John was the messenger whom God sent to precede the Messiah in order to prepare the people to receive the Messiah. (10)
\bttq In verse 11 Jesus continued talking about how important John was. To whom did Jesus compare John when he said that John was the greatest among them?
\tqe He compared John to everyone who had been born before/up until that time. (Except Jesus himself. Since he was the speaker, he could omit himself from the comparison.) (11)

\tqe There are several interpretations: 
\tqe 1. The kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing and people of power have been trying to use it for their own personal advantage.
\tqe -OR- 
\tqe 2. From the time John the Baptist began preaching and baptizing, eager multitudes have been pressing/thronging into the kingdom. (12)
\an (Note: There doesn't seem to be a conclusive interpretation of this verse. NIV favors the second one.)
\bttq Before John the baptizer had come, how did the people know how God wanted them to live?

\tqe Jesus said that the people of that time were like the children who would not mourn/cry, when other children tried to interact with them by singing [funeral] songs. (16-17)
\bttq How was that comparison in verses 16 and 17 like the way many of the people of John's and Jesus's time acted?
\tqe Many of the people would not respond to John nor to Jesus. No matter what John and Jesus did those people were not satisfied. John did not eat or drink/fasted and the people said that he had a demon.
\tqe Jesus ate and drank/did not fast and the people said that he was a glutton and a drunkard. The people also said that Jesus was a friend of tax collectors and sinners. (18-19)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant would show that what John and he did was the right thing to do in each case?
\tqe Jesus meant that eventually the end result of what they did would prove that they did what God wanted them to do. That is, they acted with [God's] wisdom. (19)

\bttq What did Jesus say to the people of Chorazin, Bethsaida and Capernaum?
\tqe He condemned/accused those people because, although/even though they saw the miracles that he did, they would not repent. (20)
\dh Details
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus expressed anger and said there would be suffering for the people of Chorazin and the people of Bethsaida?
\tqe The people from those two areas saw his miracles, but they did not repent as the non-Jews of that time, who lived in Tyre and Sidon, would have repented completely. (21)
\tqe The people to whom Jesus was speaking knew that God had destroyed the people of Sodom because of their great wickedness.
\an (Note: It may be necessary to make reference to their wickedness in the translation by a footnote to make Jesus's meaning clear here if the fact of their wickedness is not known by the readers.)
\bttq What did Jesus say would have happened if the miracles that had been done in Capernaum would have been done in Sodom?

\tqe He would cause them to have rest from their burdens/heavy concerns of sin. (28)
\dh Details
\bttq For what did Jesus praise his Father?
\tqe He praised God because he had given understanding concerning "these things" to humble people, but not to the wise people. (25-26)
\bttq What do you think were some of the important values/teachings the "ordinary ones" understood more than the "wise"?
\tqe The ordinary people understood that John was God's prophet to prepare people for the Messiah's coming; and that Jesus was the Messiah sent from God. With this kind of understanding they could repent and become people of God's kingdom. (1-25)
\an (Note: Don't expect new hearers of the text to necessarily produce all of the parts of this answer; but if they do, great. For some difficult questions, part of the questioning process is to eliminate any far out, wrong answers that do not agree with scripture. Here the "these things" refers back to general discussion in the context concerning the Kingdom of God and the introduction of the Messiah king. It is difficult to know exactly what all is covered by "these things" here. The context in that sentence helps by showing that it takes a simple humble spirited person, helped by God, to understand. This indicates that "these things" are spiritual matters. Then we look for spiritual matters which individuals need to understand in this context. This searching back is going to be difficult for anyone with only a rather quick going over of the text. Rereading verse 1-25, after the question is read, may help. The meaning may need to be made more explicit.)
\bttq From verses 25 and 26, what do think Jesus said that pleased God the Father?
\tqe It says that it pleased the Father to give special understanding concerning who Jesus really was to the humble, less educated people than to the supposedly wise highly educated people. (25-26)

\tqe They were to become his disciples/people and to learn from him, so he could cause them to have the peace they wanted. (29)
\bttq What did Jesus say about the responsibility he would give to them, compared to what they had been experiencing/having?
\tqe He said it would be relatively easy for them. (30)
\bttq What responsibility do you think the people, to whom Jesus was speaking, had been feeling/experiencing?
\an They had the burden of trying to satisfy the requirements of the Old Testament law — the Ten Commandments, as well as all of the ceremonies of the Old Testament system. Then they often had to meet the demands of the "wise and learned" religious leaders of that time who did not have compassion on them or try to help them.

\tqe They did that because they were hungry. (1)
\bttq What did the Pharisees say about what they were doing?
\tqe They said that the disciples were breaking the law by working on the day of rest. (2)
\tqref MAT 12.3-8
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus reminded them about what David did?
\tqe What David did was against God's/the laws given by Moses for carrying out the Jewish ceremonies. Thus, what David did was somewhat like the disciples/a lot like this situation with the disciples harvesting a bit of food on the rest day.
\bttq What had David done that was somewhat like/a bit like what the disciples were doing?
\tqe David had gone against the law concerning special bread that was kept in the temple. Only the priests were allowed to eat that bread. When he and his men had arrived at the temple hungry, he had asked the priest and received from him some of the special bread and ate it. He gave some of the bread to his men and they, too, ate some of it. (3-4)
\bttq Do you think it was justifiable/lawful/acceptable to God for David and his men to eat that special bread at that time?
\tqe Yes, it was.
\bttq What do you think is the reason that it was lawful/acceptable to God/permissible?
\tqe David and his men were truly hungry and there was no other food. (3)
\bttq From reading verse 5, do you think Jesus thought the Pharisees had or had not read the part in the Old Testament law that said that the priests could work in the temple area on the Sabbath? Or did he think that they had not read that part, since that portion of the Old Testament said that they could work on the Sabbath, and it would not be sin for them?
\tqe He assumed that they had read it. He was just reminding them of another case when it was all right for people to do some work on the Sabbath. (5)
\bttq Who or what did Jesus say was more important than the temple?
\tqe He himself was more important than the temple. 
\tqe -OR-
\tqe  The kingdom of God for which he and his disciples were working was greater than the temple. 
\tqe -OR- 
\tqe He and the kingdom of God were greater than the temple. If work could be carried out on the Sabbath for the temple service, how much more it could be done for him and/or for God's kingdom which they were promoting. (6)
\bttq What did Jesus say the Pharisees did not understand?
\tqe Jesus said that the Pharisees did not understand what God meant when he said that he desired that people have mercy on others. But rather they were ruthless to others; and then later they sought God's forgiveness when they had not been merciful to others. (7)
\bttq What people would the Pharisees not have condemned, if they had understood and obeyed the way God wanted them to be merciful?
\tqe They would have been merciful and not spoken out against Jesus's disciples for picking grains of wheat/harvesting food when they were hungry. (7)
\bttq What do you think it means when a person condemns someone else?
\tqe Key Term Check: When a person condemns someone else he pronounces the other person guilty of committing a crime and declares that the person will be punished for what he has done. (See "condemn" in KBT in the "judge, judgment" entry.)
\bttq About whom was Jesus talking when he mentioned the Son of Man?
\tqe He was talking about himself. (8)

\tqref MAT 12.9-14
\bttq When Jesus went into the synagogue who was there?
\tqe A man with a withered hand was there. (9-10)
\bttq What is the reason that the Pharisees asked Jesus if it was lawful/all right to heal on the Sabbath day?
\tqe They wanted to see if they could dare/provoke him to say or do something that would give them a reason to accuse him of working on the Sabbath. (10)
\bttq How did Jesus answer them?
\tqe He said that if any of them had a sheep which fell into a large/big hole on the Sabbath, they would pull it out, which was work (as the Old Testament said they could do on the Sabbath). Then he said that people are much more valuable than sheep, so it is lawful to/all right by God's law to do good to people on the Sabbath day as well. (11-12)
\bttq Then what did Jesus say to the man?
\tqe He told him to stretch out his hand. (13)
\bttq Then what happened?
\tqe While he was stretching out his hand Jesus healed it. (13)
\bttq What did the Pharisees do after that/then?
\tqe They went from there and began/started planning together how they could kill Jesus. (14)

\bttq By using the Old Testament quotation/quote from Isaiah's writings, what was Matthew teaching/making clear about Jesus?
\tqe Matthew was teaching/revealing to/showing his readers that the promise which/that God had made through Isaiah was being fulfilled in/by Jesus. That promise was that God's chosen Servant, the Messiah, would be revealed to them; and Matthew wanted to emphasize that Jesus must truly be the predicted Christ for whom they had been waiting. (17-21)
\bttq What are some of the characteristics/attributes that God mentioned about his chosen servant which Matthew quoted in verses l8-2l?
\tqe The attributes which God mentioned about his chosen servant include the following: 
\tqe 1. God loved his chosen servant. (18)
\tqe 2. His servant pleased him. (18)

\tqe No, he did not agree with them.
\bttq What were some of the details/incidents/points Jesus used to show that he did not have an agreement with Beelzebub to cast out demons?
\tqe He told them that any group that divides into two sides, and those sides start working against each other, will not last very long. Therefore, Beelzebub would not do that against his own demons. (25-26)
\tqe He said that, if it takes an agreement with Satan to cast out demons, then how was it that some of their own people claimed to cast out demons. (27)
\bttq What did Jesus say it would prove to people if they realized that he really had cast out demons?
\tqe It would show that he truly was the offspring of king David. Therefore they could know that God was ruling over them. (28)

\bttq Did the leaders of the Pharisees agree with the people that Jesus must be the Messiah for whom they had been waiting?
\tqe No, they did not agree. (24)
\bttq What did the Pharisees say about the miracles that Jesus performed/did?
\tqe They said that Jesus could only cure such a demon possessed man by making an agreement with Beelzebub, the leader of the demons, who then permitted/gave authority to him/allowed him to cast out the demons. (24)
\bttq Who is this Beelzebub?
\tqe That is what they called the leader of the demons, who is usually called Satan. (24)
\bttq How do you think Jesus knew what the Pharisees were thinking?

\bttq Who was the strong man Jesus was really talking about in these verses?
\tqe Jesus was referring to Satan. (29)
\bttq What did Jesus mean when he said that you have to tie up a strong man well before you can rob from his house?

\bttq Can you think of something which/that the Pharisees did that would have caused Jesus to talk in that manner/like that?

\bttq When they/people read this, what kind of sins do you think they/people should expect that God will forgive, or will not forgive?
\tqe They should expect that God will forgive all kinds of sin, but deliberately defaming the Holy Spirit is very dangerous. It is possible to sin in such a way/commit a sin which/do something that God can never forgive. (32)
\bttq Will God forgive people who defame other people?
\tqe Yes, God will forgive people who defame other people, according to verse 31.
\bttq What sin will God forgive according to verse 32?
\tqe Verse 32 states/relates/says that God/he will forgive people who defame the Son of Man. (This phrase "son of man" can be understood as parallel to verse 31 with the same meaning as the word "man" in that verse. But probably it is better to understand Jesus to be referring to a specific man, that is, himself, Jesus the Messiah (in his human form) here in verse 32.

\tqe It is our experience that a good tree will have good fruit and that a bad tree will have bad fruit. It just does not happen the other way around. Of course Jesus was pointing out that the same is true with people. (33)
\bttq Whom did Jesus call the offspring of vipers?
\tqe He was talking to the Pharisees or to the Pharisees plus any others who were there who thought as/in the same manner as they did. (34)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that Jesus called them the offspring of vipers/poisonous snakes?
\tqe He called them that because they were evil. (34)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant by "careless words"?
\tqe He meant anything a person/people might say without first considering if what he/they said would result in good being done rather than bad being done. (36)
\bttq To what was Jesus referring when he talked about people being acquitted and about them being condemned?
\tqe He warned them to prepare themselves for God's final judgment. He said what a person says will make a great difference in whether God can accept that person or not accept them. (37)

\rf Matthew 12:38-45 The Pharisees and Teachers of the Law asked Jesus to do a sign/miracle for them.
\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 12.38-45
\bttq What did some of the Pharisees say that they wanted Jesus to do in verse 38?
\tqe They said that they wanted him to do something supernatural which they could see. That might prove to them that he had power from God. (38)
\bttq Since Jesus had just cured a man who had been blind and could not speak, what do you think was the reason that those Pharisees asked Jesus to do something miraculous?
\tqe They wanted him to prove that he had power from God. But also they asked that because they did not believe that he was the one sent from God (and they did not want to believe).
\dh Details
\bttq About whom was Jesus probably talking when he said, "this generation"?
\tqe The scribes and Pharisees were the ones who asked to see a sign/miracle. So he was talking about them, and probably also everyone else living at that time who had not believed in him, but who would hear of people killing him and of his coming to life again after three days. (39-41)
\bttq What do you think a sign/miracle is?
\tqe Key Term Check: A miracle/sign is an unusual event, which can only be explained as a special action by God (or, in some contexts, of some other supernatural power). (See "miracle, sign" in KBT.)
\bttq What do you think Jesus meant when he called them an "adulterous" group of people?
\tqe He meant that they were breaking their covenant with God as/in the same manner as some people break their marriage promise or covenant. He meant that they were unfaithful to God and that they were doing evil. (39)
\bttq The "sign of Jonah" is mentioned in verses 39-41. What sort of sign was that?
\tqe Jonah was saved from drowning in the sea by God, who sent a sea monster to swallow him. After three days and nights the sea monster spewed/vomited/spit him out onto the land. Likewise he/Jesus would be resurrected from death after three days. (39-41) (See the OT text concerning Jonah.)
\bttq Whom did Jesus mean when he said that, 1. Something or, 2. Someone greater than Jonah was there?
\tqe 1. If we understand/consider what he said to mean "something greater than Jonah," then Jesus meant the message about the kingdom of God, a message greater than the one proclaimed by Jonah. 
\tqe -OR-
\tqe 2. If we understand/consider what Jesus said to mean "someone greater than Jonah," then, of course, he would be referring to himself—the Messiah as being greater than the prophet Jonah. (41)
\bttq What did Jesus mean by his statement that, at the time of judgment, the people of Nineveh would be a witness against the Jewish people of Jesus's time?
\tqe He meant that the Nineveh people had repented when they were warned by Jonah, but the Jewish people of Jesus time refused to repent although/even though Jesus was greater than Jonah, the one who told the Ninevites to repent. (41)
\bttq If the translated text has "Queen of the South," without mentioning her country, Sheba, then ask: From where did the queen come?
\tqe The queen came from a country far south of where the Jews lived. (42)
\an (Note: It will probably be best to mention Sheba in the text or in a footnote so that the readers will know that she was not from Israel.) (42)
\bttq How will what the queen did testify against/convict the people of Jesus's generation, at the time when God judges the people of earth?
\tqe The Queen of Sheba came all the way to Israel in order to hear some of King Solomon's wisdom. The Jews of Jesus day refused to listen to the Messiah, who had much greater wisdom than Solomon had. Therefore, God will judge/punish them. (42)
\bttq What did Jesus mean when he talked about a number of unclean spirits coming and taking up residence where only one of them had been living previously?
\tqe He was warning the Jewish nation that it was about to happen to them, since they did not repent and did not truly turn to God. (43-45)
\bttq What do you think is the reason that Jesus talked about the evil spirit going through dry places/uninhabited places, as the evil spirit wandered around when it had no place to stay?
\tqe By speaking of dry places/uninhabited places, Jesus disclosed/revealed/showed that the evil spirit expected to find another person in whom he could live again. (43)
\bttq What do you think an evil spirit is?
\tqe Key Term Check: The terms "evil spirit", "unclean spirit", and "demon" are used interchangeably in the New Testament. They all refer to spiritual beings who serve Satan as his agents, being under his authority. These spiritual beings have power to oppress a human being and even to take control of him. (See "evil spirit" in KBT.)
\bttq In this account/his little story, Jesus said that the evil spirit left the person and later came back to that person, but whom was he really warning?
\tqe He was warning the people of Israel including the scribes and Pharisees of verse 38, who refused to believe Jesus. (45)

\bttq Who came looking/to look for Jesus?
\tqe His mother and [younger] brothers came looking/to look for him. (46)
\bttq How did Jesus know that his mother and brothers were there?
\tqe People in the crowd around him told him. (47)
\tqref MAT 12.48-50
\bttq Was Jesus asking the people a question that he wanted them to answer?
\an If there is not a question in the translation at the beginning of verse 48, omit this question and the following one.
\tqe No, he was not. (48)
\bttq What do you think he was doing?
\tqe He was gaining their attention, so that he could teach them. (48)
\bttq What did Jesus mean when he pointed to his disciples and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers"?
\tqe He meant that those, who do according to what God wants, are in close relationship to him, just like brothers, and sisters and a mother. (49-50)
\bttq Do you think that Jesus refused to go and talk to his own family?
\an Matthew did not tell us about that, but only about what Jesus was able to teach the people because of their coming to see him.
\an (Note: Jewish teachers used to begin/start with something that was happening and then teach something else from it. When the crowd mentioned family, Jesus started from that thought and taught about his close relationship to people who obey God. This was the important part/component of the teaching which Matthew wanted to emphasize. He did not bother to go back and tell us more about this incident and whether Jesus talked with his mother and brothers afterward or not. He probably did.)

\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 13.1-9
\bttq In this parable, what did Jesus say about the different seed that fell to the ground as the farmer was sowing his crop?
\tqe There was great variation in the soil on which that seed fell and the results were different with each kind of soil:
\tqe Some seed did not have a chance to sprout.
\tqe Some sprouted, but did not grow well.
\tqe Other seed sprouted and grew. Some of these plants produced one hundred grains of seed, some of these plants produced sixty grains of seed and some of these plants produced thirty grains of seed. (3-8)
\bttq What do you think a parable is?
\tqe Key Term Check: A parable is a story which shows its meaning indirectly by using picture language to make a comparison. The parts of the comparison are generally not explained. The listeners themselves must think much about the meaning hidden in each part of the picture language. Jesus taught spiritual truths in this story form. (See "parable" in KBT.)
\bttq What did Jesus teach the people about listening carefully to him?
\tqe He taught them to listen carefully and to follow the good message that they heard. (9)
\dh Details

\tqe Verse 2 states/indicates that there were large groups of people gathered around him. (2)
\bttq So what did Jesus do?
\tqe He got into the boat. (2)

\bttq What was the topic of the main/most important parable?
\tqe This story was about a man who sowed seed in his field. (3)
\bttq How did the man plant/place/sow the seed for growing in his field?
\an (Note: Check whether the manner of sowing is clearly tossing/scattering, since some fell where people would not ordinarily plant seed, if they were to dig, plant and then cover it up.) (3)
\bttq What happened to some of the seed?
\tqe Some seed fell on the path at the edge of the field and the birds came and ate it. (4)
\bttq What happened to other seed?
\tqe Some seed fell on soil with rock underneath. It came up quickly, but its roots did not develop, so it wilted from the heat of the sun and dried up. (5-6)
\bttq Where did other seed fall?
\tqe Some seed fell where thorny weeds grew. Those weeds prevented the good seed from growing well, so it did not produce/bear anything. (7)
\bttq What happened to the other seed?
\tqe Other seed fell on good soil, grew well and produced a crop. Of those seeds that grew on the good soil, some produced thirty times more seed than was sown, some produced sixty times more seed than was sown and some produced one hundred times more seed than was sown. (8)
\bttq What did Jesus mean by what he said in verse 9?
\tqe He meant that they needed to think seriously about this parable so that they would understand it and be able to learn from its warning. (9)

\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 13.10-17
\bttq To whom did Jesus always tend to speak in parables?
\tqe Jesus always tended to speak in parables to the crowds of people. (10)
\bttq What do you think was the reason that he spoke to them mostly in parables?
\tqe He spoke to them mostly in parables because they did not want to hear what he taught them/would teach them nor did they want to accept/receive it and turn to God. (They would probably have rejected his message immediately and stopped coming to hear him, if he had talked to them in plain speech.) (11-15)
\dh Details
\bttq What did the disciples want to know about the way Jesus taught?
\tqe They wanted to know why he always spoke in parables to the crowds of people. (10)
\bttq What was Jesus's first reply to their question?
\tqe He said that God had given them an understanding of what previously had been unknown about God's kingdom/the way God would rule over people, but he had not given that understanding to other people. (11)
\bttq Verse 12 sounds like an often-repeated saying; and we know that Jesus used it on at least one other occasion, applied to something else. What do you think he meant in this verse?
\tqe Jesus was saying that God will give much more understanding of him and his kingdom to the people who already have some understanding. As for those who have almost no understanding of him and his kingdom, he will take way even the little that they do know. (12)
\an (Note: Check for any far out misunderstanding of this verse. Some possible meanings suggested by various sources are: 
\an 1) They have so little understanding of God, that at the time of God's judging of people, their understanding will be counted as nothing.
\an —OR—
\an 2) When he teaches in parables they will realize/see that their original views do not fit, but will still not understand nor be forgiven by God.
\an —OR—
\an 3) They will lose the Old Testament law, but they will not gain understanding of the new covenant nor be forgiven by God.)
\bttq What is the reason that he spoke to them in parables?
\tqe He spoke to them in parables because they saw him doing miracles, but they did not understand what they were seeing. And even though they heard Jesus's message, it did not mean anything to them. So he used parables, which was the right thing to do when speaking to a rather hostile audience who were not really trying to learn from him. (13)
\bttq How did what the prophet Isaiah said about the people of Israel fit what Jesus said about the crowds following him?
\tqe The people to whom Jesus spoke/The people about whom Isaiah wrote were set in their ways/calloused in heart and would not listen to the message Jesus wanted to tell them, nor learn from what he was doing among them. (14-15)
\bttq What is the reason that the people about whom Isaiah wrote and the people whom Jesus was teaching did not want to respond to God's message?
\tqe If they had listened, they would have learned from the message and understood in their hearts what he was teaching them. Then they would have turned to him and he would have placed/put them in a right relationship with God. (15)
\bttq What was it that the disciples saw and heard that other people before them had longed to see and hear?
\tqe Other people, who had lived before them, had longed to see the Messiah and to hear more about how God would rule over people after he/the Messiah came. (16-17)

\bttq What do you think Jesus meant by "the evil one"?
\tqe The evil one refers to Satan. (19)
\bttq How do you think rock in the soil would cause seed not to grow well?
\tqe Some of the soil had patches where only a bit of soil covered rock underneath. The roots of the new seedlings could go down only to the rock and could not draw enough moisture to stay alive. (20)
\bttq To what sort of people did Jesus say this part of his parable was to be applied?
\tqe The seed on rocky soil represents people who hear God's truth and enjoy it, but they discontinue/quit following God just a short time later. (20-21)
\bttq What causes them to stop following God?
\tqe Any difficulties related to their following God, including their being persecuted by others will cause them to stop following him. (21)
\bttq What did Jesus say about the people who are represented in the parable by the seed that fell among the thorny weeds?
\tqe The seed which fell among the thorny weeds represents people who hear God's message and accept it. However, they become so concerned about this life and about having money that the message can not have any good influence on them. (22)
\bttq What happened to the seed that fell on good soil?
\tqe It grew up and produced thirty, sixty or even one hundred times more than what was sown. (23)
\bttq What do you think people, who read this, will understand about the thirty, sixty and one hundred fold increase to mean?
\tqe This increase means that the message did what was expected of it. That is, the message was received by a person who took it seriously. That person not only started, but also continued to serve God as expected. (23)

\rf Matthew 13:24-30 Jesus told the parable about weeds.
\oh Overview
\tqref MAT 13.24-30
\bttq What plan of action did the farmer take when he realized there were weeds mixed with the wheat in his field?
\tqe He told his workers to allow the weeds to grow there until harvest time when his harvesters could easily tell the difference between the weeds and the wheat (because of the seed heads being quite different). They could then gather the weeds to burn them; and they would store the wheat in his storehouse. (30)
\dh Details
\bttq To whom was Jesus referring when he talked about a man who sowed good seed, planned how to care for it and then would have his servants harvest the wheat?
\tqe Jesus was talking about God, who is the owner of the field and he is the one who will be in charge of/supervising the "harvest". (24)
\tqe He was talking about people who truly belong to God as his "harvest". (24-30)
\bttq What is the kingdom of heaven like?

\bttq How had the weed seeds come into the garden?
\tqe An enemy of the owner had secretly planted them there. (26-28)
\bttq What was the owner's plan to separate/for separating the weeds from the real wheat?

\tqe Those who believed Jesus were a small group now. Many would believe Jesus in the future. (31-33)
\bttq What did Matthew say about Jesus in verses 34-35?
\tqe Matthew made/makes it clear that it was to be expected that Jesus would teach in parables, since that had been predicted in the Old Testament. Then the fact that he spoke in parables was a proof of his being the Messiah. (34-35)
\dh Details
\bttq What do you think might be the reason that Jesus mentioned the birds resting in or nesting in the branches of the mustard plant?
\tqe It showed that the plant was large. Therefore, God will rule over many people. 
\tqe Also it may or may not indicate that Jesus meant that religious sects, or others like them, would try to take advantage of the great size and influence of God's kingdom on earth. (32)
\bttq How much bread do you think the flour, that the woman used, might make?
\tqe There would have been about 55 lbs or 25 kilos of flour. So she could have made many loaves of bread. The main point to understand is that it was a huge batch of bread which shows the potential/capability of yeast to increase the volume of the batch. Therefore, the kingdom of God will spread and have great influence. (33)
\bttq Was it right for Jesus to teach in parables?
\tqe Yes, it had been predicted in the Old Testament that the Messiah would speak in parables. (34-35)

Usually God is the one who states/decides/says what will happen, that is, what he will do and what people must do. He binds himself to the other party. (See "covenant" in KBT.)

(Or, if it can be pluralised, the meaning may be something very different from the English "gods". In one language, the plural form of God, meant "God and those who follow him" and was an appropriate way to translate "saints".) (See "God" in KBT.)

\tqe The Holy Spirit was/seven spirits were before his throne. (4)
\bttq What do you think he meant by "spirit" in this verse?
\tqe Key Term Check: The seven spirits are generally understood as a way of talking about the Holy Spirit. The imagery seems to be derived from Zechariah 4. Some commentators think they refer to the seven chief angels or archangels, who are known also from Jewish tradition. But the fact that the seven spirits are grouped with the eternal God and Jesus Christ suggests that the Holy Spirit is meant, not angelic beings.

\bttq What do you think a priest does?
\tqe Key Term Check: The particular part of meaning in focus in this verse seems to be the idea of entering into God's presence, becoming his servants and offering "spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ". Another intermediary apart from Jesus Christ is not needed; the believer can enter into God's presence directly through him. (See "priest" in KBT.)

\tqref 1CO 6.11
\bttq Can such sinners ever enter God's Kingdom?
\tqe Yes, if they repent and turn from their sins. Some of the Corinthian Christians had been like that.
\bttq How is a sinner changed and what happens to him?
\tqe The Holy Spirit washes away his sins in the name of Jesus Christ and presents him to God and frees him from his guilt.

\tqref 1CO 6.12
\bttq If Christians say, "I am permitted to do anything I want", what do you answer from this verse?
\tqe If something seems to be permissible, also ask yourself, does it help you, does it help your fellow men? If it is going to get control over you, then stop it.
\tqref 1CO 6.13
\bttq In this verse what sins is Paul speaking against?
\tqe Greediness for food, adultery and rape.
\bttq What do these sins have in common?
\tqe They are all sins of the body.
\bttq From this verse how do you answer the one who says that he can use his body in any way he wishes?
\tqe We should use our body, as well as our heads and hearts, to worship God and he will take care of our bodies in return.

\bttq If we as Christians belong to Christ, what does God promise to do with our bodies?
\tqe He will raise them from death to life again, as he raised Christ from death.
\tqref 1CO 6.15
\bttq Why does Paul say that it is very bad especially for a Christian to sleep with a prostitute?
\tqe Because as Christians every part of our body belongs to Christ. Would we expect Christ to lie with a prostitute?
\tqref 1CO 6.16
\bttq In the verse quoted from God's word book, (Genesis 2:24), who is it that become united?
\tqe Husband and wife.
\bttq What is Paul teaching?
\tqe Sexual intercourse makes a marriage because in this way man and woman become united. So if a man has intercourse with a prostitute, it is as if he has married her.
\bttq Discuss: What does this teach us concerning a man having intercourse with his girl friend or his promised wife before he has taken her to his house?
\tqe Suggested answers: He should refrain from intercourse till he has brought her to his house and married her. Or if he has had intercourse with her he should by all means marry her.
\an NB. If these teachings cannot be understood from the verses as translated, suggest alterations.
\tqref 1CO 6.17
\bttq How do we unite with Christ?
\tqe Not by sexual intercourse. But the Holy Spirit makes us to be of one mind/united with Christ.
\tqref 1CO 6.18
\bttq What do adultery and rape have in common?
\tqe They are sins against one's own body. (See 6:13.)
\bttq What of all other sins? Are they sins?
\tqe Yes, but they are sins against other people.
\tqref 1CO 6.19
\bttq Give two reasons why it is wrong to use our bodies for sexual sins.
\tqe 1. Our bodies belong to God not to ourselves alone.
\tqe 2. The Holy Spirit lives in our bodies.
\bttq Give another illustration, using a building, to explain Paul's teaching.
\tqe Just as it would be wrong to use a church as a brothel, so it would be wrong to use our bodies to sleep with a prostitute.
\tqref 1CO 6.20
\bttq What does this "golden rule" say?
\tqe Use your bodies in such a way that people will see how you live and will praise God.

\rf 1 Corinthians 7:1-16 Concerning marriage.
\tqref 1CO 7.1-16
\tqref 1CO 7.1
\bttq Why does Paul say that if a man does not marry he does well?
\tqe Paul was unmarried. He believed that the end of the world was coming soon, so that people should pay attention to that and not to marrying. (See verse 26.)
\bttq Does he say that marriage is wrong?
\tqe Not at all.
\tqref 1CO 7.2
\bttq What reason does he give that it is good for men and women to marry?
\tqe So that they will not be tempted to commit adultery and rape.
\tqref 1CO 7.3-4
\bttq Why does Paul give this command?
\tqe 1. The same reason as in 7:2, that is, to prevent the other from committing adultery with another person.
\tqe 2. Because the husband and his wife belong to each other, that is, they have the right to ask the other for sexual intercourse.
\an NB. Is this well understood?
\tqref 1CO 7.5
\bttq What exception does Paul give to this rule?
\tqe 1. First they should agree together not to sleep together.
\tqe 2. It should be for a short time.
\tqe 3. It should be for the purpose of having time for more prayer.
\tqe 4. Then they should come to sleep together again.
\bttq Why should it be for a short time alone?
\tqe If not so the Devil will tempt them to love another woman/man.
\bttq Does Paul speak of a man's wife or wives?
\tqe He speaks of a man having only one wife.
\tqref 1CO 7.6
\bttq These things are not a law but are permission/are good advice. Which things?
\tqe 1. Verse 5 - The refraining from sexual intercourse for a little time. OR
\tqe 2. That every one should marry. This is the preferred interpretation.
\tqref 1CO 7.7
\bttq Why is it only permission/good advice?
\tqe Because some can refrain from marriage and be happy, but others cannot be happy until they marry. Each one has his gift from God which is different from his fellow man's.
\tqref 1CO 7.8
\bttq Whom does Paul advise not to marry if they are able to refrain from marriage?
\tqe Unmarried men and widows.
\tqref 1CO 7.9
\bttq What is marriage to prevent from happening?
\tqe It is not good that a man remains single, but be always wanting a wife. Or for a woman (widow) to remain single, and always be wanting a husband.
\tqref 1CO 7.10-11
\bttq What is Paul teaching?
\tqe It is wrong for a man to divorce his wife or for a wife to divorce her husband. But if they do separate neither husband or wife should marry another person. They should try to be reconciled.
\bttq What kind of law is this?
\tqe It definitely comes from our Master Jesus Christ.
\tqref 1CO 7.12
\bttq Does Paul encourage a Christian to marry a non-Christian?
\tqe No. (See 2 Corinthians 6:14.)
\bttq What then is he saying?
\tqe That if, for example, the husband becomes a Christian, but his wife does not, this is not a reason for him to divorce her.
\bttq How then should he act? What should he do?
\tqe If the wife is willing to stay with him, he should not divorce her.
\tqref 1CO 7.13
\bttq What does this verse say?
\tqe The same as 7:12, but in the case where the woman is a Christian and her husband is not.
\tqref 1CO 7.14
\bttq What is the reason for all this?
\tqe 1. A Christian makes his/her non-Christian wife/husband no longer to be unclean in the sight of God.
\tqe 2. This is also the same for their children.
\bttq Does that mean that the non-Christian wife/husband has become a Christian or will go to heaven?
\tqe No. He has to make his own decision. (See verse 16.)
\bttq Is the child of a person who is a Christian also a Christian?
\tqe No. He has to make his own decision.
\tqref 1CO 7.15
\bttq What is Paul teaching here?
\tqe If the non-Christian wife/husband wants to leave her husband/his wife, let him do so, and do not force him/her to return.
\bttq Why so?
\tqe Because God wants us to live at peace with one another.
\bttq Does this give permission to divorce and remarriage?
\tqe Some commentators say that this is so. Others say it is not so. The main thing is to avoid fighting.
\tqref 1CO 7.16
\bttq Why does he think that a Christian wife might save her husband (and a husband save his wife)?
\tqe Because this should be one of the reasons that a Christian will remain with her non-Christian husband (wife).
\bttq What does Paul mean by "saving"?
\tqe That God will save the husband/wife because of the way that wife/husband lives and speaks.

\tqref 1CO 7.17-24
\tqref 1CO 7.17-24
\bttq What is it that Paul says that we should not change?
\tqe The way we are living at present - married, unmarried, circumcised, uncircumcised, slave or freeman.
\bttq Why?
\tqe Probably the answer is in verse 15 - let us live in peace, and verse 29 - the time is short, Christ will return soon and verse 19. Our way of life is of less importance than keeping God's commands.
\bttq Do we change our sinful way of life?
\tqe Yes.
\bttq What is more important than the "status" that we have, that is, married, unmarried, slave or freeman?
\tqe Following God's commands.
\tqref 1CO 7.21-23
\bttq Is Paul saying that slavery is good?
\tqe No, because he says that if a slave has the chance to get free, he should do so. No one should willingly become the slave of another man - verse 23.
\tqref 1CO 7.22
\bttq How has the coming of Christ changed slavery?
\tqe Both master and slave now belong to Christ, who is over both master and slave.
\bttq Is Paul saying that slaves are now free and freemen are now slaves?
\tqe No. Both are free from sin and the Devil and now serve Christ.

\tqe It is wise not to change one's status by marrying or divorcing.
\bttq Is it wrong to marry?
\tqe No.
\bttq Why does Paul advise them not to marry?
\tqe So as to avoid the kind of troubles that married people suffer.
\bttq Is Paul making a law for them?
\tqe No, he is only giving them good advice.
\tqref 1CO 7.29
\bttq What time is now not much?
\tqe Some say: the time when Christ will come again, others say: the troubles that Christ said would come upon all people before Christ returns.
\tqref 1CO 7.30-31
\bttq Why does Paul give this advice in these verses?
\tqe Because of how the world is now changing.
\bttq Should we not care for our wives and children anymore? Should we refuse to perform funerals anymore?
\tqe No, Paul wants us to live our lives so that the Kingdom of God is more important than the things of this world.
\tqref 1CO 7.32-35
\bttq Can an unmarried man/woman please God?
\tqe Yes, but since he/she is also trying to please his wife/her husband, he/she does not have all his/her time to go to God. He/she cannot do both well.
\bttq Why does Paul give this advice?
\tqe It is for their own good, that they might do what is right and worship our Master with all their hearts.
\tqref 1CO 7.36
\bttq When is it good to marry?
\tqe When the girl who is promised in marriage is already of marriageable age, and the man is unable to control himself.
\bttq What does this verse say about your marriage customs?
\tqe A man should not sleep with his wife until he has married her.
\tqref 1CO 7.37
\bttq What permission does Paul give here?

\tqref 1CO 7.38
\bttq In Paul's opinion is it better to marry or not to marry?

\tqref 1CO 8.1-3
\bttq What do you think was the question that the Corinthians had asked Paul and he is now answering?
\tqe Should we eat food or animals killed for fetishes?
\bttq Why does he speak about knowledge and being wise? What did the Corinthians say in addition to their question?
\tqe Fetishes are nothing, therefore, they said, they can eat food/meat offered to them.
\bttq How does Paul answer their "wisdom"?
\tqe If a person is clever, or has knowledge, he will become proud.
\bttq How should he use his knowledge?
\tqe He should use it to strengthen his fellow Christians in their faith.
\bttq What is the best kind of knowledge that a man should want?
\tqe To know and love God so that God will know him, that is, God will accept him as his own person.
\tqref 1CO 8.4-5
\bttq What does this teach us about fetishes?
\tqe 1. They have no power in this world.
\tqe 2. There are many fetishes, some say some are on the earth and some in heaven.
\tqe 3. Some people call them master and worship them as if they are God.
\tqref 1CO 8.6
\bttq What do we learn about God from this verse?
\tqe 1. He alone exists - there is no other.
\tqe 2. He created us.
\an NB. Is it absolutely clear that Paul is saying that fetishes do not exist, except that people believe that they exist?
\bttq Whom are we permitted to call our Master?
\tqe God and Jesus Christ.
\bttq What shows that Jesus Christ is equal to God?
\tqe Because through Christ, God created the world and gave us life.
\tqref 1CO 8.7
\bttq What kind of people are those whose consciences are weak, that is, their hearts are troubled concerning eating food that has been offered to fetishes?
\tqe They are those who have recently become Christians and they still believe that fetishes exist and have power.
\bttq What, for such people, is the result of eating fetish food?
\tqe Their hearts become dirty.
\tqref 1CO 8.8-11
\bttq What foods does Paul taboo eating?
\tqe None.
\bttq How can we please God in what we eat?
\tqe It does nothing for us in God's sight to eat or to taboo any food.
\bttq Why then does Paul taboo the eating of food that has been offered to fetishes?
\tqe Because if we eat it, and one who has a weak conscience, that is, he believes that fetishes exist and have power see us, and also eats, he will fall into sin and go back to worshipping fetishes and stop believing in Christ, and God will send him away from his presence forever.
\tqref 1CO 8.12
\bttq If you through eating fetish food cause a fellow Christian to sin, what is that to you?

\tqe If our eating such food causes a fellow Christian to sin, then we should not eat such food anymore.

\tqref 1CO 9.1-27
\tqref 1CO 9.1
\bttq Why does Paul have to say that he is free?
\tqe Because in 8:13 he puts himself under a law, which is not really a law, for the sake of others. But he is free to live how God tells him.
\bttq What shows that he is free?
\tqe He is an apostle of Jesus.
\bttq What shows that he is truly an apostle of Jesus?
\tqe 1. He has seen Jesus with his own eyes.
\tqe 2. They, the Corinthians, came to believe in Jesus because of Paul's work for Jesus.
\tqref 1CO 9.2
\bttq Who of all people should not say that Paul is not an apostle?
\tqe The Corinthians.
\bttq Why so?
\tqe Because they became Christians through Paul's work.

\bttq What two rights does Paul claim for himself and all apostles?
\tqe 1. To get food and drink for the work he does.
\tqe 2. To be accompanied on his journeys by a Christian wife.
\bttq Of Paul, Peter and Jesus's brothers, which ones had a wife who accompanied him on his journeys?
\tqe All except Paul.
\tqref 1CO 9.6
\bttq Why does Paul ask this question?
\tqe Because the Corinthians never offered him any money for food and drink.

\bttq What proverbs or examples does Paul use to teach?
\tqe 1. A soldier does not serve at his own expense, paying for his own food.
\tqe 2. A farmer eats food from his own farm.
\tqe 3. The owner of a cow drinks the cow's milk.
\tqe 4. A cow that treads (guinea) corn to thresh it for the farmer is allowed to eat some of it.

\tqref 1CO 9.12
\bttq Did Paul and his fellow teachers claim food and drink from the Corinthians while he was in their town?
\tqe No.
\bttq Why not?
\tqe So that nothing would prevent the preaching of Christ's good news from going forward.
\bttq Why would accepting food and drink hinder God's work?
\tqe Because some would falsely accuse Paul of preaching only to get money.
\an NB. Is this well understood?
\tqref 1CO 9.13-14
\bttq What further illustration/proverb does Paul use to prove his case?
\tqe Priests/Sacrifice offerers eat some of the meat that people offer to God.
\tqref 1CO 9.15
\bttq Is Paul wanting something from them for his preaching to them?

\bttq Why?
\tqe So that he can boast that he is working for them for nothing.
\an NB. Is it clear that "for nothing" means "without receiving any payment"?
\tqref 1CO 9.16-17
\bttq Do you understand why Paul cannot boast about the fact that he preached to them, but he can boast that when he preached, he did not collect money from them?
\tqe If it had been true that he chose of his own will to preach, then he could rightly claim payment. But as it was God who forced him to become a preacher, like a master makes a slave work for him, he cannot claim a reward, he is only doing his duty. If he fails to preach, God will punish him.
\tqref 1CO 9.18
\bttq Will Paul get any reward at all?
\tqe His reward in this life is the right to refuse a reward from men. But we know that now he has received his reward from God in heaven.
\tqref 1CO 9.19
\bttq What other right does Paul refuse to use?
\tqe To be free from following any man.
\bttq Why did he make himself everyone's slave?
\tqe To make as many as possible become Christians.
\tqref 1CO 9.20-22
\bttq In what way did Paul become a slave to everyone?
\tqe When he lived among Jews he followed their laws, although, he was free from following those laws, so as to win Jews for Christ. But when he lived among those who are not Jews, he did not follow the Jews' laws.
\tqref 1CO 9.21
\bttq Why would some accuse Paul of being against God's law?
\tqe Because the Jews received their laws from God.
\bttq Is Paul really free from God's law?

\an NB. If this is not understood, make suggestions for alterations.

\bttq How did Paul help those whose faith in Christ was weak?
\tqe He became like them.
\bttq In what way can we become like those whose faith is weak in order to help them?
\tqe For example, if we want to help someone who believes that it is wrong to eat certain foods, then for his sake we will not eat such foods, though there is no law of God that forbids us to eat such foods. (See 1 Corinthians 8:9-13.)

\bttq What does Paul use this proverb about running to teach?
\tqe The proverb: Train for the race every day and then run so as to win the race. The reward is a crown/hat of leaves. The meaning: try hard to live the Christian life, and do not slacken. Try to be better than other people in following Christ. Your reward is a place of authority in heaven.
\tqref 1CO 9.26-27
\bttq What does Paul use this proverb about boxing to teach?

\bttq If Christians join in the sacrifices offered to fetishes and eat the meat that is sacrificed to fetishes what does that show?
\tqe That they are worshipping fetishes and are united with fetish worshippers.
\bttq Does that show that fetishes really do exist and that sacrificing to fetishes has a value?
\tqe No, what they do not know, but which is true, is that the fetishes are really the devil and it is the devil that fetish worshippers are worshipping.
\tqref 1CO 10.21-23

\bttq Why did Paul try to please others?
\tqe So that God might save them.

\bttq Why should we imitate Paul?

\bttq Why does Paul say that a man who covers his head when praying or prophesying and a woman who does not cover her head when praying or prophesying, is bringing shame upon himself/herself?

\tqref 1CO 11.5-6
\bttq How do you understand what Paul is saying?
\bttq What does it mean for a woman to shave her head?
\tqe That she is performing funeral. But if they shave her head, (and it is not for a funeral) then it is for a punishment. Whichever reason it is, a woman whose head is shaved should cover her head.
\bttq If a woman refuses to cover her head when prophesying or praying, what is she doing?
\tqe She is refusing to accept the authority of man over her and so she deserves to have her hair shaved off as a punishment.
\bttq Discuss: Is Paul making a rule for all time or is what he says a custom which is different from time to time and from tribe to tribe?
\tqref 1CO 11.7
\bttq Why did God create man first and woman second?
\tqe So that through man, God's greatness might be seen and through woman, man's greatness might be seen.
\bttq Does this mean that in woman is not seen the greatness of God?
\tqe It seems to mean that man is first among equals, for whatever greatness man gets from God, it is shared with his wife.
\tqref 1CO 11.8-9
\bttq In what way did God use man to create woman?
\tqe According to Genesis 2:21-23, God took a bone from man's body and used it to make a woman.
\bttq Why did God make a woman?
\tqe To help man and to be his wife.

\tqe When they go to church, they divide up into many groups.
\bttq Why is this not good?
\tqe It shows that Christians are not united.
\bttq Is it always wrong to have arguments among Christians?
\tqe No. If some people are wrong and some are right, then a discussion/argument will reveal who is right and who is wrong.
\tqref 1CO 11.20-21
\bttq What was wrong with the way they were eating our Master's supper?
\tqe Each brought food and ate it alone by himself; some even got drunk, while others on the other hand sat and had nothing to eat. That is, those who had brought food did not share it.
\tqref 1CO 11.22
\bttq What does their behavior show about their thoughts?
\tqe They had no respect for their fellow church members, especially those who were poor and had little food, and so they were not respecting the church.

\tqref 1CO 11.23-24
\bttq Is what happened at the first Master's supper just the opinion of Paul?
\tqe No, it is a teaching that has come from Christ himself.

\bttq Until when should Christians continue to eat our Master's supper?
\tqe Until his second coming.
\bttq In short what is the meaning of the bread and the wine?
\tqe Christians are again telling one another of the reason why Christ died.
\tqref 1CO 11.27
\bttq If we show disrespect to our Master's supper what does that show?
\tqe That we disrespect Christ's body and blood, that is, we have no respect for the reason for his death.
\tqref 1CO 11.28
\bttq How can we avoid disrespect to our Master's supper?
\tqe By looking into our hearts before we come to eat and drink.
\tqref 1CO 11.29
\bttq In short what should we remember if we are to avoid God judging us guilty of disrespect?
\tqe The bread stands for Christ's body.
\tqe The wine stands for Christ's blood.
\tqe They both stand for his death for us.
\tqref 1CO 11.30
\bttq Why have some Corinthian Christians become weak and sick and some have died?
\tqe God has judged them guilty of disrespect to our Master's supper and has punished them.

\bttq In what way is God merciful in his disciplining of Christians?
\tqe He disciplines us now in order to save us from being judged and punished in the same way that he will punish the bad people of this world.

\bttq What two simple rules will help them to have respect for our Master's supper?

\bttq If someone says, "Jesus is my Master", who or what caused him to say it?
\tqe God's Holy Spirit.

\tqe 2. The Holy Spirit in all.
\bttq What does this baptism do for our relationship with other tribes and social classes?
\tqe We all belong to one family.
\tqref 1CO 12.14-16
\bttq What does this proverb teach in respect of the church?
\tqe No one member of the whole church of Christ can say that he is not a member just because he does not have the same gift as a fellow member.
\tqref 1CO 12.17
\bttq What also does this proverb teach in respect of the church?
\tqe There would be something wrong with the church if everyone was a pastor, or everyone was a prophet, because all the gifts are needed for a strong church.
\tqref 1CO 12.18-20

\tqe None of us, as members of the church, can do without the other members and their gifts. They are someone to us. The smaller need the greater.

\bttq What shows that we have love for our fellow man?

We don't force others to do what we want, we don't get angry and we don't seek revenge. We are not happy when someone does wrong, we are happy when someone does good.

\tqref 1CO 13.11
\bttq What does Paul use the proverb to show?
\tqe Our present life is like that of a child, who knows only childhood things and whose wisdom is small. In our life when Jesus comes again we will know all things.
\tqref 1CO 13.12
\bttq What two other proverbs does Paul use to describe this life of ours on earth?
\tqe A riddle and a mirror that is not clear.
\bttq When Jesus returns, how will our knowledge be?
\tqe Like that of God and how God knows us very well now.
\tqref 1CO 13.13
\bttq What will pass leaving only faith, hope and love?

\bttq In verse 8 Paul says that only love will continue, but now he says that also faith and hope will continue. How is this so?
\tqe If we love our fellow man we will also trust him and hope in him. If we love God we will also trust him and hope in him. (Also see verse 7.)
\bttq In what way is love greater than faith and hope?
\tqe 1. When we see (God and) Jesus face to face we will continue to love him, but we do not any more need to trust and hope in one whom we now see face to face.
\tqe 2. Our faith saves ourselves. Our love saves others.
\bttq Can we just love God and our fellow man and leave off trusting and hoping?
\tqe No, because our trust in Jesus makes us love him and hope for his coming. Our love for our fellow man makes us trust him and hope for him to do what is good.
\bttq Are faith, hope and love gifts from God in the same way as prophecy, wisdom, etc.?
\tqe 1. They are greater/more useful gifts. (See 12:31.)
\tqe 2. They are gifts, without which we cannot be Christians.
\tqe 3. Therefore everyone should ask God for them.
\tqe 4. As for the other gifts we can ask God, and if he agrees he will give them to us.
\tqe 5. But these other gifts do not make God think we are better people because we have gifts.

\bttq This verse is connected with Ch. 13. What is the connection between love and prophecy?
\tqe Love is something we should all get in our hearts. But prophecy is the most important of all God's other gifts.
\bttq Why is prophecy very important?
\tqe It is God speaking directly through a person, revealing his thoughts to human beings.
\tqref 1CO 14.2
\bttq Why is prophecy more important than speaking in another language?
\tqe 1. Other people can understand prophecy since it is spoken in our language.
\tqe 2. If someone speaks in another language, neither he nor other people understand him.
\bttq If that is so, what use is speaking in another language?
\tqe He is speaking to God and praising him, but only God understands what he is saying.
\tqref 1CO 14.3
\bttq What good does prophecy do?
\tqe It helps other Christians, it strengthens their faith and it gives them comfort.

\bttq So does Paul say that it is not good to speak in another language?
\tqe He wishes all to have the gifts of prophecy and speaking in another language.
\bttq Under what circumstances can speaking in another language be as useful as prophesying?
\tqe When the speaker can also interpret the language into the language of his fellow church members.
\tqref 1CO 14.6
\bttq What does this add to the previous verses?
\tqe That Paul himself did not speak to the Corinthians in a language that he did not understand.
\tqref 1CO 14.7-9
\bttq What do these proverbs teach?
\tqe We must speak a language that our fellow men will understand, if not so they will not mind us.
\tqref 1CO 14.10-11
\bttq What is the thing that really separates one people from another?
\tqe That they each speak a different language.

\bttq For what reason should we ask the Holy Spirit to give us gifts?
\tqe So as to help our fellow church members.
\tqref 1CO 14.13
\bttq What gift is better than speaking in other languages?
\tqe The power to interpret other languages.
\tqref 1CO 14.14-16
\bttq Why is speaking in other languages that we don't hear not helpful?
\tqe 1. The speaker does not understand his own words.
\tqe 2. The hearers do not understand him and so they cannot agree or disagree with him.
\bttq How should we worship God in prayer and song?
\tqe With heart and mind, that is, with sincerity and understanding.

\bttq In what language should we pray and speak in church?

\tqe When we pray alone to God.
\tqref 1CO 14.20
\bttq In what ways does Paul say it is wrong to be childish and right to be childish?
\tqe They should think like adults in respect of the gifts of speaking; but like children they should be free of bad thoughts and deeds.
\tqref 1CO 14.22
\bttq Looking at verses 21 and 22, say how speaking in foreign languages is a warning to those who don't believe.
\tqe If people refuse to believe God's words when he speaks to them in their own language, he sends people speaking foreign languages. This warns them that God is not happy with them. A sign without an interpretation is a worry to people.
\tqref 1CO 14.23-25
\bttq Show how verse 22 does not contradict 23-24.
\tqe When God sends people speaking in foreign languages to us it is God warning us. If we speak in a language that is the gift of the Holy Spirit it does not help our fellow believers, and it seems like madness to those who do not belong to our church. But if we speak in our own language what God reveals to us (prophesy) and a non-member comes in and hears us, maybe that person will hear God speaking to him and will repent of his sins and believe that God is truly among us.
\tqref 1CO 14.26-28
\bttq In summary how does Paul recommend that they should conduct their church services?
\tqe Freely, but in an orderly way; everyone taking part as God leads him, but one after the other and in order; in a way which will help one another and make their faith increase.
\bttq What kind of things are good for a church worship service?
\tqe Songs, teaching, prophesy (what God reveals to someone) and speaking in a language that the speaker does not understand if someone can interpret it.
\tqref 1CO 14.29-30
\bttq What does Paul say about prophesying?

\tqe They should listen carefully.
\tqref 1CO 14.31
\bttq What is the reason for people being allowed to prophesy in church?
\tqe To teach and encourage fellow church members.
\tqref 1CO 14.32-33
\bttq How do you understand these verses?
\tqe 1. A prophet has control over the words that he speaks. He can wait till the time is right for him to rise and speak.
\tqe 2. God does not want noisy, disorderly church meetings.
\tqref 1CO 14.34-35
\bttq Give two reasons why women should keep quiet in church meetings.
\tqe 1. So that the meetings do not become disorderly.
\tqe 2. Because women are under men's authority.
\bttq If a woman has a question to ask, how will she get an answer?
\tqe By asking her husband at home, that is, if he is a Christian and has been with her at church.
\bttq Discuss: Is Paul making a rule for all times and all peoples or is he only repeating what was the Jewish and Christian custom of his time?
\tqref 1CO 14.36
\bttq Why does Paul ask these (rhetorical) questions? What is he saying?
\tqe They in Corinth have no right to change the customs that have been accepted in the other churches, especially since they were not the first Christians.
\tqref 1CO 14.37
\bttq From whom does Paul say that this law about women comes?

\bttq How does Paul summarize this chapter?

\tqref 1CO 15.3
\bttq What are the most important things that we should believe in the good news of Jesus Christ?
\tqe 1. That he died to wash away our sins.
\tqe 2. He was buried and on the third day God raised him from death.
\bttq Why is this good news not an invention by Paul?
\tqe 1. He received this teaching from others.

\tqref 1CO 15.8-9
\bttq Why does Paul liken himself to a child who is born late?
\tqe Because he was the last of the apostles to see the resurrected Christ.
\bttq Why was Paul not worthy to be an apostle?
\tqe Because before he saw Christ on the road to Damascus, he persecuted God's church people.
\tqref 1CO 15.10
\bttq Why did he become an apostle?
\tqe Because God had mercy on him and made him become what he is now.
\bttq Is Paul boasting?
\tqe He says he has worked harder than all the other apostles, but it is with God's strength that he has done this. He became an apostle, not because he was good, but because God had mercy on him.
\tqref 1CO 15.11
\bttq What difference is there between Paul's preaching of the good news and the other apostles' preaching?
\tqe None. It is the same message preached by them all and the same message that all the Corinthians have believed.
\tqref 1CO 15.12
\bttq Some Corinthians said that people who have died will not rise to life again. Why is this teaching wrong?
\tqe Because all the apostles have taught that Christ himself was raised from death.
\tqref 1CO 15.13
\bttq How is our belief that we will rise again connected to our belief that Christ rose again?
\tqe If one is false, both are false. If one is true, both are true.
\tqref 1CO 15.14
\bttq If it is not true that God raised Christ from death what does that show?
\tqe 1. That the preaching of the good news is for nothing and is a lie.
\tqe 2. That the Corinthians believing the good news is for nothing.
\tqref 1CO 15.16-17
\bttq What does Paul say in addition to verses 13-15?
\tqe He repeats his thoughts and adds that our being free from sins is because Christ rose from death. If he did not rise then what we believe is a lie and our sins remain on us.
\tqref 1CO 15.18
\bttq If our faith is a lie, what of those who were Christians and have died?

\bttq What false teaching can be understood here?
\tqe That Christ was not born but came straight from heaven to earth.
\bttq What is the true teaching about Christ's coming to earth?

\bttq Who will collect back/destroy the power of death?
\tqe God.
\tqref 1CO 15.56
\bttq What is the connection between death, sin and the law?

\tqref 1CO 15.57
\bttq For what, then, should we thank God?

\bttq Since this is so, can we relax and know that we need do nothing except believe in Christ?
\tqe Our belief that certainly we will go to heaven and also rise from death at the end of the world should make our faith stronger and make us work even harder for our Master Jesus Christ.
\bttq What further comfort do we have in our work for him?
\tqe There is nothing that we do for him which is for nothing.

\tqe The apostle John wanted the Christians and the apostles, including himself, to have complete joy. (4)
\bttq What do you think it means for someone to have fellowship with someone else?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means to have companionship. The word "fellowship" refers to a relationship between two or more people all of whom have something in common or all of whom/who participate in the same activity. The same Greek word may also be translated in certain contexts as "sharing", "participation", or "partnership". (See "fellowship" in KBT.)
\dh Details

\tqe John said that God is light, there is no darkness in him at all. (5)
\tqe If anyone wants to have fellowship with God he must walk in the light. (6-7)
\bttq Who do you think God is?
\tqe Key Term Check: In English, the term "God" with a capital "g" is used to refer to the one supreme Creator. The term "god" with a small "g", as in "a god" or "many gods", can refer to any spiritual being that people worship. The Greek word theos can be used in the same two ways. 
\an In many languages the term for God is a proper name and cannot be used to refer to anyone except the one supreme creator of the world. It cannot be pluralised. (Or, if it can be pluralised, the meaning may be something very different from the English "gods". In one language, the plural form of God, meant "God and those who follow him" and was an appropriate way to translate "saints".) (See "God" in KBT.)
\bttq In your language, do you use the word "light" as a figure? If you use the figure, what does it mean?
\an (Note: Some languages have a problem in translating the word for light in a figurative sense.)

\tqe He heard it from him [Jesus Christ]. (5)
\bttq If we say we have fellowship with God, but at the same time, we walk in the darkness/do evil deeds, what are we saying?
\tqe We are lying and 
\tqe we are not putting the truth into practice/not living by the truth. (6)
\bttq If we walk in the light/do not do evil deeds, we will have fellowship with God. With whom else will we have fellowship?
\tqe We will have fellowship with other believers. (7)
\bttq How does God forgive our sins?
\tqe He forgives us because Christ died for us. (7)
\bttq What does a person do when he sins?
\tqe Key Term Check: He disobeys God. He deliberately keeps on doing those things that please himself and displease God. (See "sin" in KBT.)
\bttq If we say that we have not sinned, what are we doing?
\tqe We are deceiving/fooling ourselves, and we are not telling the truth. (8)
\bttq What are we to do when/if we have sinned?
\tqe We are to confess/admit/acknowledge our sins to God. (9)
\bttq Then what will God do?
\tqe God will forgive us of our sins, and
\tqe he will forgive our sins. (9)
\bttq What do you think happens when someone forgives someone else?
\tqe Key Term Check: Forgiveness always involves two people, one of whom has done something wrong to the other and offended him. Forgiveness takes place when the one who was offended sets aside his right to justice and decides not to punish the offender as he deserved. If the one who offended repents and accepts this forgiveness, then the result is that the relationship between the two, which was broken by the offence, is restored, and the guilt of the offender is removed. (See "forgive" in KBT.)
\bttq How do we know that God will really do that?
\tqe We know that he will because God does what he says he will do, and because God does everything correctly. (9)
\bttq What do you think it means when someone is faithful?
\tqe Key Term Check: It means that someone will do what he says he will do. A person is worthy of being believed by someone else. They are trustworthy, reliable. (See "faithful" in KBT in the "believe" entry.)
\bttq What do you think it means for someone to deal with someone else justly?
\tqe Key Term Check: He does only what is right to do. Doing something in conformity with law or justice. It refers to God's faithful and consistent adherence to his covenant. (See "just" in KBT.)
\bttq If we say that we have not sinned, what do we think about God?
\tqe We think that God is a liar, because God has said that all people have sinned. (10)
\bttq What is meant by "his word has no place in our lives"?
\tqe It means that we have not believed his word nor allowed it to change our lives. (10)

\tqe Key Term Check: It is all the people who live on the earth. (See "world" in KBT.)
\bttq What does it mean to you that Jesus became the atoning sacrifice for everyone?
\tqe Key Term Check: He died to take the punishment for our sins. The penalty for sin was death, but "God graciously permitted the death of a sacrificial victim to substitute for the death of the sinner". The sin of the person having been transferred to the victim, atonement was made, that is, fellowship between the person and God was restored. Jesus is the sacrificial victim who paid the price for everyone's sins. (See "atonement" in KBT.)
\dh Details
\bttq To whom did John write this letter?
\tqe He wrote it to the Christians/his children. (1)

\bttq If someone does sin, who will come to their defense?
\tqe Jesus Christ will speak to the Father in their defense. (1)
\bttq What is the reason that the Father will listen to Jesus Christ?
\tqe He will listen to Jesus, because he is completely good. (1)
\bttq What do you think it means for someone to be righteous?

\bttq How can we be sure that we really know God?

\bttq What was the new meaning of that command?
\tqe It was that they were to love one another as Christ had shown how to love people by the way he lived. (8)
\bttq Why is this true?
\tqe This is true because the darkness of evil is passing and the true light, which is the truth about God, is becoming known to people. (8)
\bttq What did John say about any person who says he is in the light, that is, he lives good as God does good; and yet hates his brother?

\tqe He was an apostle of Jesus Christ. (1)
\bttq What do you think an apostle does?
\tqe Key Term Check: He is a person sent by Jesus Christ. The general meaning of the Greek word apostolos is "envoy", "appointed representative", "someone who is sent on a mission". In the New Testament it develops the specific sense of an appointed representative of Jesus Christ. In Acts and the rest of the New Testament, the term "apostle" is the most common term that is used to refer to those who were commissioned by Jesus Christ to be founders of the church . (See "apostle" in KBT.)

\an In many languages the term for God is a proper name and cannot be used to refer to anyone except the one supreme creator of the world. It cannot be pluralised. (Or, if it can be pluralised, the meaning may be something very different from the English "gods". In one language, the plural form of God, meant "God and those who follow him" and was an appropriate way to translate "saints".) (See "God" in KBT.)

\tqe God had chosen them to be his people. (2)

\tqe He did it through the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. (2)

\tqref 2CO 12.6
\bttq Why does he boast of that revelation and not of other things?

\tqref 2CO 12.17-18
